If you are a painter either professional or a DIY one, you should understand that painting like any other handiwork comes with a number of health risks.

Painting seems like a risk-free task but the truth is that it can cause serious harm to your body and of others if the right protective clothing and safety precautions are not taken into account. The major risk comes from the paint itself. Paint is made from chemicals that are harmful to human beings and in the event that it touches a person's skin or eyes there is severe irritation that can cause damage. Also, the paint fumes can cause respiratory issues and headaches to the painter and anyone else in the vicinity who is exposed to the paint.

Further, the products that are used alongside painting such as thinners and primers are highly flammable in their nature. If they spill over, they can cause a fire that can burn people working there and the car is painted. Lastly, the exterior painting of a car requires the painter to use a ladder to enable reaching the very top of the car. Scaling such a height is a hazard because it can break or have some instability that can cause the painter to fall from the top and sustain injuries.
