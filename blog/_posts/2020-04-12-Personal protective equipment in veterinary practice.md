First in the veterinary clinic they must have certain cleaning areas such as hand washing areas, container areas for sharp objects (needles, scalpels) and isolation area for sick animals, however personal protection is also important to be able to access certain areas or practice.


### 1. Body Protection


Thanks to this protection we will be reducing and avoiding much of the contact with the skin, as well as avoiding contact with body fluids, chemicals, bites (ticks).


The protection of this would be: apron, gown, dust cap and overalls (fabric, tear resistant and resistant to chemicals).


### 2. Facial and eye protection

The protection of the face in general (eyes, nose and mouth) is paramount to consider to prevent biological and chemical agents as well as diseases. Surgical masks, respirators, face masks and goggles should be available.


Wearing a face mask and goggles can protect the skin of the face and prevent splashes as well as drops of blood and other materials. Surgical masks help keep the medical area sterile by containing breathing excretions. A respirator for personal use should cover the nose and mouth and this helps us to reduce the risk of the veterinarian inhaling dangerous particles such as pathogens.


### 3. Protection for hands and feet


Wearing gloves prevents the transmission of some diseases and bacteria, there are different types of gloves for every occasion: examination gloves, palpation sleeves, chemical resistant gloves, metal gloves (cut resistant), and common work gloves.


With respect to footwear, these must be non-slip with a closed tip, there are some types of footwear and elements for them: work boots, rubber boots with respect to elements such as shoe covers and disposable plastic boots.


### 4. Hearing protection


It is important for a veterinarian due to the constant noise that can generate animals can gradually cause a hearing loss so it is important to wear earplugs for the times you think they should be used to also avoid some discomfort during their practice.


### 5. Protection for sharp objects


One of the most frequent things are those cut with needles in veterinary life and consequently this could cause infection so it is important to take into account to re-cover the needles and have the areas available for when a practice is made once used a needle should throw it immediately in its area of authorized cutting objects.
