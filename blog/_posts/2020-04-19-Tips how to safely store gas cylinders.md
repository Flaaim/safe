Gas cylinders are quite heavy especially when they are full. If left to leak, they can lead to fire explosions. Therefore, you should ensure that the personnel in charge of handling the cylinders do wear protective footwear and gloves when carrying them. The gas cylinders should not be rolled, thrown or dropped onto the surface. If you have large gas cylinders, you can use a lift or trolley to move them into the storage unit.

## Restrict entry

It's important for you to ensure that it's only people who understand fully how to handle the gas cylinders well are allowed to access the storage area. Also, ensure that the storage area is located away from high traffic areas or busy paths such as passages for vehicles, people, stairways, emergency routes or corridors. You can use visible warning signs around your gas storeroom.

## Proper ventilation of the storage area

You must ensure that your storage room is well ventilated, cool and dry. In this case, ventilation is vital as it will ensure that any unexpected releases of flammable or toxic gases will not be trapped within the storage room. This can be hazardous. If possible, you can store all your gas cylinders outdoors in a well ventilated, weatherproof, secure store or cage. This is to ensure that if any accident occurs would not affect the nearby property
