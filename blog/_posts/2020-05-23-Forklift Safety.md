When you consider the severity of accidents, even when riding a bicycle, you understand why forklift safety parts are needed. The forklift safety parts are meant to protect the truck driver, others in the work area, and the truck itself. The forklift's safety components and safety techniques are designed to protect in all directions.amaging an important part of the body such as the hands.

## Operator safety

Forklift driver safety begins with proper training and accreditation. Only adequately licensed drivers can drive a forklift to make sure they don't hurt anyone else. Cab enclosures provide the shell that protects the driver. For seated trucks, the seats must be equipped with rollover protection to protect the driver in the event of a rollover. Seat belts and full-body harnesses provide fall protection for the operator. Standing truck access bars are equipped, with alarms that sound when the bar is not in place. Guards are installed to protect the operator from materials that may fall from high loads.

## Safety of others

Some forklift safety parts take into account the protection of others in the workplace. Beacons and strobe lights, front and rear lights, reversing alarms, horns and mirrors are designed to prevent others from being hit by the truck. Other parts and safety procedures for forklift trucks are intended to protect the car itself. Fire extinguishers are mandatory equipment on all vehicles. Loads should lean back and be carried no more than 15 cm from the ground.

Although emission control equipment is not considered a safety part for forklift trucks, it does play an essential role in ensuring the safety of drivers and others in the work area. Forklift trucks are often used in confined spaces, such as warehouses and containers. Faulty emission control equipment can cause everyone in the environment to be exposed to harmful air pollutants. Improper emission control can also cause damage to the truck's engine.

Safety procedures also extend to parts of the other forklift systems. When engine parts, ignition, steering, and lifting systems do not meet standards, government regulations specify that the truck must be grounded. The forklift cannot be reused until the defective parts have been repaired or replaced. Familiarity with safety standards developed by government agencies like OSHA will help forklift drivers to develop comprehensive safety programs.


Proper inspection and maintenance programs will go a long way in ensuring the safety of all people associated with the forklift operations. Installing appropriate safety components for forklift trucks can reduce or eliminate unplanned downtime and protect the lives of workers.
