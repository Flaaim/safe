Your Health and Safety Management System is one of the most important tools you have to ensure your health and safety programme works effectively.

It's important as it gives you a system to monitor, maintain, improve and control your company's health and safety.

Today, we're revealing 22 things you must check, whether you already have a Management System or you're starting to create one, to make sure it's inline with the OHS.

 
Use this checklist to ensure your Health and Safety Management System is compliant

4. Did you establish a risk assessment group to conduct the risk assessment for your organisation? 
5. Have you planned how to identify hazards and assess risks? 
6. Do you have an incident investigation procedure? 
7. Do have records of your health and safety efforts? 
8. Did you take your employees input into consideration with the planning phase of your safety management system?
