Children's playgrounds are a great thing to have and really appreciated by parents (not too many McDonalds restaurants don't have one!). But they are perhaps one of the most hazardous areas of your operation and sadly also one of the most neglected.

Injuries: Falls from equipment are the largest cause of serious injury in the playground. Other injuries include entrapment; collisions with equipment, needle stick injuries, cuts from broken glass, protrusions and other children; 

Issues: We have seen hazards such as: 
1. Rusty protruding nails & screws 
2. Splintered timber 
3. Sharp metallic edges 
4. Needles & syringes 
5. Brittle and cracked plastic seats 
6. Red back spiders in cubby houses 
7. Broken glass 
8. Concrete play surfaces 
9. Bricks and rocks on the ground around equipment 
10. Swings too close to fences, walls and other equipment 
11. Hanging ropes and chains with noose like loops tied in them 
12. Potentially live wires hanging from damaged light fittings


A safe playground should have:
1. Fencing similar to that required around swimming pools
2. Equipment without protrusions and entrapment hazards
3. Equipment that is appropriate for the age of the children using it
4. An adequate soft fall surface for all equipment. 
5. Shade and seating for supervision by parents
6. Rules displayed ie appropriate ages, no food or drink, no glass, no running etc
7. Signage indicating that children should be under adult supervision at all times
8. Be regularly inspected and maintained, especially the soft fall surface. Details records of these inspections should be kept.
