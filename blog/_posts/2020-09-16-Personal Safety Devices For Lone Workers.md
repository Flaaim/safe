## Introduction
Whether you are working on an oil rig in the middle of nowhere or you are a community health worker working at odd hours, your personal safety is vital and should be put at the forefront. Finding ways to ensure your lone workers are safe and connected is essential, but where do you begin? 



## Key Considerations
Since there is a myriad of lone safety devices out there, it can be an overwhelming experience. For starters, you need to find out your workers' needs and what they expect from the device.

Are your lone workers' tech-savvy, and do they prefer extra gadgets on them during working hours? If not, look for a product that can seamlessly fit in with their working schedule.


Where are your lone workers located? Sometimes, their working schedule takes them to different locations. If not, you should strike the location feature off your checklist.


Who'll be monitoring your lone workers? A gadget is only useful if someone at the other end can monitor and respond promptly. Most of these gadgets allow users to develop a custom action response plan concerning impending risks.


So, what are some of these safety devices?



### Wearable Devices
These are products pinned or attached to the worker's safety suit. They either detect gas and chemical leaks and offer two-way communication, GPS location, or other features. The worker must carry them to work fully powered and attach it before their beginning shift. Such include gas and radiation detectors. Since they are attached, workers can effectively work with both their hands. The only drawback is that they become ineffective when the worker signals for help.
### Carrying Devices
They are similar to the worn devices, only that they need to be charged up and carried to the job. The worker should always be aware of where the device is, in addition to their tools of trade.


The only disadvantage to such personal safety devices is that they aren't hands-free. It's okay for workers who only need them for a short while or those who'll not use both their hands when working.



### Alarms
Employers offer their lone workers alarms as a potential threat deterrent. Such alarms come in a myriad of ear-piercing or shrill voices catering for front line workers such as health workers, among many others. The best devices come with such noise and a connection to law enforcement agencies; otherwise, they are no different from doorbells.



### Mobile Phones
Phones can be an add-on to the existing lone safety devices carried by lone workers. Many lone safety worker applications offer features such as "check-ins, SOS, and worker down buttons." Charging a separate device can be tricky, but incorporating a phone would solve the problem since most workers bring them to the job and hardly forget to charge them.


However, most of them aren't useful since one needs to unlock the phone and navigate the app to hit the SOS or panic button. The chances are high that you can hardly do that when seriously injured or unconscious.


## Conclusion
The list of safety devices is endless. It is upon employers to ensure that their workers are never alone and that the gadgets chosen are practical. Discuss with your team to come up with what works for everybody.
