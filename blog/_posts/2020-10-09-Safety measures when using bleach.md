Bleach, also known as "chlorine bleach", is a common, powerful cleaning agent found in most homes. It is primarily used as an additive for laundry detergents in whitening clothes and sheets. Bleach in its purer chemical form of "sodium hypochlorite" is an effective cleaner, disinfectant, and sanitizer. It is highly effective in killing bacteria, mold, mildew, and viruses on surfaces. As such, using bleach is both helpful and risky. Knowing how to properly and safely handle bleach in cleaning your home is very important to eliminate the risks.

## 1. Read the instructions before using

Governments require manufacturers to provide clear and easy instructions on how to use their products. They usually come in the form of stickers, labels, or print at the back of the bottle or on the box. Take time to read and understand the instructions. Follow the recommended amount to use for certain materials. And if you have further questions, refer to the provided contact information.

## 2. Use Personal Protective Equipments

Sodium hypochlorite is a corrosive substance and irritant. You must take precautions by protecting your eyes, skin, and respiratory system. Wear wraparound safety glasses to protect your eyes. Wear rubber household gloves to protect your hands. Make sure you gently pour the chemical on the surfaces to avoid splashes. When it does touch your skin, wash with a gentle stream of water. To avoid inhaling the fumes, ventilate the room by keeping the windows open.

## 3. Diluting bleach

Bleach is just as effective when diluted as when used at full strength. A one-third cup of bleach can be mixed to a gallon of warm water. And after mixing properly, it can be used.

## 4. Mixing bleach with other cleaners is dangerous

Mixing bleach with water is the safest way to mix bleach with another substance. Don't combine sodium hypochlorite with other cleaners found in the house because it can create chemical reactions. For example, when you combine bleach with ammonia, limescale removers, or vinegar, you can create fumes that are toxic and can have side-effects like shortness of breath, chest pains, and even pneumonia.

## 5. Before using bleach, remove dirt and grime with an all-purpose cleaner

Bleach does not remove grease, dirt, and grime because it is not a cleaner. Use an all-purpose cleaner first. Another alternative is to use an all-purpose cleaner that contains bleach.

## 6. Don't spray the bleach

Don't pour the bleach into a spray bottle unless you're using a spray cleaner with bleach. Most spray bottles that can be purchased often have metal parts that tend to corrode when it comes to contact with bleach, pure or diluted. The corrosion will reduce the disinfecting strength of the bleach. What is the best way to use bleach? Dip a sponge into the solution, wring it out, and use the sponge on the surface.

## 7. Don't use bleach on porous surfaces

You can use bleach in different types of nonporous surfaces from floor to ceiling, from doorknobs to sinks, tubs, countertops, faucets, and toilets. Avoid using bleach on porous materials like upholstery, foam, and bare wood. Bleach can leave stains on upholstery and it can cause wood to swell. As a basic rule of thumb, check the instructions to see what surfaces the bleach can be used on. If in doubt, test it on a small area first.

## 8. Keep out of the reach of children

Store your bleach where anyone who does not know how to use it cannot easily get access to it. Secure drawers by adding security measures like locks. Inform your kids about what to do when they come in contact with bleach.
