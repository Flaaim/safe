Ethanol is a volatile, colorless, and flammable liquid with a characteristic odor. It is a product of the fermentation of sugars in yeast and is the primary ingredient in most alcoholic drinks. Ethanol is a substrate of the water molecule, making it versatile in mixing with water and other liquids. But why is it dangerous? Its flammability makes ethanol hazardous because it can quickly start fires. Inhalation can also cause irritation and coughing. So, what are the precautions taken when handling ethanol?


## Safety Precautions of Ethanol

### First Aid Measures


If ethanol is in contact with skin, wash the contaminated area with soap or a mild detergent and water. Ensure you remove the clothes in contact with ethanol and clean them thoroughly to avoid further contact.

If in contact with eyes, wash the eyes with plenty of running water for about five to fifteen minutes. You should seek medical attention if irritation persists. 
 
Ethanol exists in diluted form in alcoholic drinks, but it can be very harmful when ingested in an undiluted state. Wash out the mouth with water and ensure the victim drinks lots of it. Also, seek immediate medical attention.
 
 ## Personal Protection
 
- Ethanol should be stored in a well-ventilated space.
- Wear respiratory masks if you're working in places with high ethanol exposure levels. For example, if working with pure ethanol for more than eight hours.
- Wear butyl rubber protective gloves when working with ethanol.
- Protect your eyes using chemical safety goggles if there are chances of eye exposure.

## Fire Control Measures
In case of a fire, close the ethanol leak and extinguish the fire using water-mist extinguishers. They work well because ethanol dissolves in water. Isolate the electric supply before using water-mist extinguishers where electricity is involved.

Shut down the source of ignition and cool off the ethanol containers exposed to fires in cold water.

Read the instructions manual carefully before installing or using an ethanol fireplace.

## Storage and Transit

1.	Ethanol in containers may form ethanol-air vapors that are highly explosive. Therefore, keep these containers away from open flames or high temperatures. Also, empty the partially full containers to avoid the formation of flammable ethanol vapors.
2.	Ground or bond the containers containing ethanol to release static electric charges that may cause sparks.
3.	Store ethanol containers in a well-ventilated space and label them well to avoid mishandling
4.	Avoid any potential sources of ignition on containers such as welding, cutting, or pressurizing.

### Spillage Control 


- In case of ethanol spillage, make sure you eliminate any potential sources of ignition.
- Keep the place well-ventilated and seal the leak if possible.
- Do not let the ethanol flow into confined spaces as it can cause an explosion.
- If in small quantities, absorb the ethanol in paper towels and evaporate in a safe place.
- If spills are in large amounts, then contact spillage management personnel


### Conclusion

Ethanol is an ingredient in many household items, including beauty products, fuel, and alcoholic drinks. While ethanol is very useful, it can be hazardous mainly due to high flammability in its pure state. Therefore, this article gives the precautions to take when handling ethanol to avoid any harm.

## Safety precautions to consider when working with ethanol:

Ethanol is a colorless, volatile, and especially a very inflammable liquid that has a slight odor that perdured for centuries since it was discovered as the result of an extreme fermentation of alcohol. Since Ethanol forms part of multiple important things that humankind requires for its survival, it shouldn't be strange to see that millions of people manipulate it every single day for industrial purposes such as biofuel, gasoline, medicines, and even some basic things like housecleaning products.

However, there is a big problem with that statement, due to its volatile nature, Ethanol is pretty dangerous to the human body, capable of causing health diseases that can provide a very annoying situation and even death if security measures are not followed, for that reason, let{s discover these security rules that everyone should follow when they get to manipulate some of it in the future, stay tuned.

The best security rules that exist in situations like these is the usage of security equipment that will provide special protection in determining parts of the body depending on what conditions you will be working with the dangerous agent or chemical and also which one will be manipulated, for example, in the case of Ethanol almost every part of the body should be protected, but if you work with other chemicals maybe you just need to protect a particular zone like your hands or face, with that being said, these are the tools and equipment that you should use when working with Ethanol.

### Security gear part #1: protection in hands

When it comes to your hands, the gear that you will require is pretty easy to obtain and use since you just will require a pair of long rubber gloves and that's it! However, you shouldn't underestimate the power of Ethanol, and since a lot of people tend to put these special gloves in an incorrect way, their hands will suffer from some irritation and other issues on the skin that may not be too deadly, but it will be pretty annoying, so make sure that the gloves are well inserted in your hands, check for any cut or point where Ethanol could reach your skin and everything will be good.

### Security gear part #2: protecting your face.

In comparison to hands, this time you need to pay a lot of attention to the explanation since more gear will be used this time, starting with the fact that a face shield will be pretty much required to avoid suffering from any contact with Ethanol particles, but that would not be enough since chemical safety goggles are also a must and what can be said about respirators? Remember that you won't be in natural situations at all, working with Ethanol is a very intriguing and passionate job, but if you don't work carefully then bad things will happen, a lot of accidents take place in this kind of practices so stay safe.

### Security gear part #3: protection in your legs.

To end this security gear you will need a pair of boots that manage to cover your ankles and legs at a perfect point where nothing can reach your skin even in unlucky situations, you just need to select some security boots that are suitable for the job and also remember something important, not adjusting enough the boots leave empty space in the kin so you need to seal that space otherwise in accidents with Ethanol that can reach your skin and even with the slightest mistake you will be ashamed of not following the measures, be careful and good job.
