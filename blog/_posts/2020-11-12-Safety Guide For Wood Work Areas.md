As with all potentially hazardous work environments, adhering to a few principles and techniques will greatly lower the risk of personal injury to yourself and coworkers within the wood working area.

## General Safety Rules
![Safety Guide For Wood Work Areas](https://safetyworkblog.com/assets/acozyspaceforstudiofurniture_lead.jpg)

Always wear personal protective equipment when in a woodwork room. Make a habit of putting your protective glasses on once you enter the work environment and not removing them until you leave. Also wear ear protection and gloves appropriate for your current task. Thick, preferably leather, gloves for working with bladed equipment that vibrates and latex or non latex rubber gloves for working with finishes and other chemicals.

Wear clothing that covers all skin from the neck down. Do not wear baggy or loose clothing that could easily snag or get grabbed by equipment. Wash these clothes every night after work, or wear a clean but similar set of clothing for the next day. This is to ensure your skin is not given prolonged exposure to dust particles and substances that have been proven to cause skin irritation and disease.

Never enter a wood working shop while under the influence of alcohol or controlled substances. This can not only lead to employment termination, but injury or death of your coworkers and yourself. Wood work is inherently hazardous. Please be responsible.

Always ensure you leave the work area clean and organized at the end of the day. Make special effort to ensure that all walking area's are clear of tools, scraps, garbage and dust. Ensure that all equipment is properly shut down with all guards and safety mechanisms in place. Store tools in proper locations where the even of toppling will not injure workers.

Identify all fire extinguishers and fire exits in the work space. Conduct proper fire extinguisher training with your supervisor or safety officer. Identify locations of all first aid and medical equipment on the job site. Inspect said equipment to ensure you feel you could use said equipment incase of a medical injury.

## Responsible Equipment Use

Never operate equipment you have not been trained on. Ensure all blades and bits are sharp and maintained before use. Always make sure power cords are not in walk ways. Ensure you know which power chord goes to which piece of equipment at all times, so that in the case of equipment malfunction or emergencies you can immediately remove power from the equipment.

Consciously shut down and ensure that all moving parts have come to a complete stop on equipment. Ensure all guards are in place before leaving equipment unattended.

Avoid all distractions while working with equipment. This is not a reflection of your competence. This is to ensure that you are ready for any incident that may arise while working equipment.

Always be mindful of which direction your hands and body could go in the case of a slip. Be mindful of where wood could be jettisoned in the case of a kick back. Be mindful of where your coworkers are standing and take precautions to not injure them as well.

## Storage

Ensure you store or dispose of all lumber, solvents, chemicals, scraps and dust in proper designated places. There are numerous ways fire can be ignited simply by improper storage and disposal in a wood work environment. Talk to supervisor for further information.
