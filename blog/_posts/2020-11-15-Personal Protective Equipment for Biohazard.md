Wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) will help to protect you from hazardous materials and organisms. This equipment includes protective clothing, goggles, and helmets. Also, other garments or equipment that are specially designed to protect you from infections or injuries are classified as PPE. Wearing PPE will protect you from various types of hazards such as electrical, chemicals, physical, heat, airborne particulate matter, and hazardous substances. PPE is worn for recreational activities such as sports as well as for occupational safety and health. However, this article will focus on the use of PPE to protect against biohazard.

## What are biohazards?

Biohazards, the shortened form of biological hazards, are natural substances that threaten the health of living things. There are different types of biohazards that you should be aware of. These are:

- Viruses
- Spores
- Mold
- Fungi
- Pathogenic micro-organisms
- Toxins from different sources
- Bio-active substances

Approximately 320,000 people worldwide die from contagious diseases associated with their exposure to biological hazards each year. For this reason, it is important to wear personal protective equipment to keep you safe from illnesses and prevent death. PPE is specially designed to ensure your safety when working with harmful substances.

## How does PPE work?

### 1. Resistance to Liquid Penetration, Permeation, and Degradation

PPE protects you from biohazards in several ways. They are resistant to liquid penetration. This means that harmful liquids cannot pass through any zippers, seams, or any other part of the protective clothing.

They also stop toxins and other harmful substances from dissolving (permeating) through the materials of protective gears. This protective equipment is also resistant to degradation. So, you donâ€™t have to worry about inefficiency due to exposure to hazardous materials.

### 2. Strength and Durability

Protective garments are put through a variety of tests to ensure they are strong and durable for different job functions. These gears do not only come in contact with biohazard. They also have to face abrasive surfaces, rigorous movement by the wearer, and machinery. So, special attention is given to strength, tightness and seam construction. Manufacturers ensure that protective equipment is of the best quality so they work effectively.

### 3. Flexibility and Dexterity

Personal protective equipment should not hinder movement or normal bodily functions such as breathing. If they do, they were not properly made. Protective equipment should be made from materials that fosters safety from biological hazards while allowing flexible movements by the wearer. You should be able to work efficiently and safely while wearing these.

### 4. Breathability and Comfort

PPE should fit properly to ensure breathability and comfort. Protective clothing that do not fit properly risk being torn, thus, exposing the wearer to harmful substances. They may also restrict movement and prevent the wearer from doing their job.

### 5. Protection Against Pathogens Borne in Blood

Persons who work with blood are at risk of being exposed to BBPs (Bloodborne Pathogens). PPE works to provide adequate protection from these infectious microorganisms. So, workers in the medical field can feel confident and safe as they perform their duties.

Wearing the right protective gears will keep you safe from biohazard. Biohazards are natural substances that can be dangerous to people. PPE works to prevent infections and death caused by exposure to biohazards
