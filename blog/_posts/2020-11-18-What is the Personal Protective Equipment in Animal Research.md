Animal research has been used for multiple purposes around the years such as the creation of medicines, vaccines or even to acquire more knowledge about the nervous system of animals and establish a relation between humans, however, there are major risks involved with this whole activity, starting for the fact that a division for safety and occupational health is created in almost every animal research laboratory since there are lots of scenarios where human scientific or medics can get infected with different dangerous and hazardous chemicals compounds, infections that can be trespassed from the animal to the human body and another kind of mutagens that could put everyone in danger, for that reason, the person needs to use a PPE or Personal Protective Equipment.

There are a lot of tasks involved in animal research such as radiology and other things like handling pollutant chemicals that could put the human body in a dangerous state of health, however, if you follow the security and safety measures then everything will be good as ever, but there is a single problem...what is this equipment and what parts of the body need to be protected? Well, let's discover every single detail about this topic in the next detailed explanation, stay tuned.

First of all, we need to make sure that every part of your face is covered against any possible danger that could be present in the laboratories where animal research will take place. One of the most used equipment will be the safety mask, since it's capable of protecting both of your mouth and nose against any chemical, gas, or bacteria that might cause havoc inside your body if it gets inside of it, after that, you need to look for something like a hearing and eyes protection device/equipment that prevents you from the previous same, in the case of the eyes a face shield will do the trick, and in the ears, some covers can be more than enough.

## Part 2: Protection for your Hands and Legs.

Thankfully, the PPE for this activity is based on covers on your original clothes, since that will be more than enough, however, when it comes to hands and legs you need to use the proper gloves that every lab uses and also you need to follow additional security measures while handling the equipment or the animals that will be tested remember that everything is for your own security and protection.

Also, for your legs you won't need security boots since in this scenario they will only slow you down, however, shoe covers can be perfect for these tasks, but it doesn't stop there, remember that after finishing your routine int hat place, you need to do a decontamination procedure where you basically put awa all fo those covers and the clothes that you were wearing need to be properly cleaned to avoid taking any chemical or bacteria to your living environment, be careful since performing this in a wrong way can cause troublematic experiences for a lot of people, stay safe and follow the measures.
