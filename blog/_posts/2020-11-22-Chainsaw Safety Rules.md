## Always treat your chainsaw with respect

By understanding the techniques needed to correctly and safely handle a chainsaw, you will minimize any risk of strain or injury.

- Always wrap your thumbs and fingers completely around the handles of your chainsaw, keeping your left hand thumb beneath the front handle to minimize any danger from kickbacks.
- Operate the chainsaw with confidence, keeping it closer to your body to remain as balanced as possible, allowing anchors and controlled movements if you're afraid of the saw this increases the possibility of injury. 
- Take a correct stance by placing your left foot in front of your right and keeping your knees bent at all times.
- Never leave the chainsaw rotating when you're moving from one place to another.
- Ensure that there's no one within 10 ft of you when operating a saw.
- If your tree has down the power line, never operate a chainsaw within its vicinity.

## Always make sure your surrounding are safe
Remember, if you are cutting a tree this is your responsibility and securing the site is on you. Inspect the tree to ensure it has no cracks or damage or decay beforehand. Make sure you which way a tree is leaning. Always cut it to fall in the direction it will fall naturally. Make a plan and always ensure there is no one within at least twice the height of the tree in any direction that may be susceptible to injury from its fall.



## Store it securely
A chainsaw is a dangerous tool when in the wrong hands, always store securely away from people and children. It's a good idea to remove the chain and store it in oil and empty the fuel tank, if you are leaving your chainsaw out of use for a season.



## Practice makes perfect
Even the most experienced chainsaw operators started by practicing on smaller pieces of wood in order to learn good habits and how to react under dangerous conditions.
