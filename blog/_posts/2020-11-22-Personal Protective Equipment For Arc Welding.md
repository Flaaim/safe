When it comes to welding, there are many risks involved, such as burns, electric shock, and radiation. According to the Occupational health and safety administration (OSHA), nearly 562,000 welders are exposed to physical, electric, and chemical hazards at the workplace. Such terrible accidents can lead to severe injuries or even death. However, personal protective equipment can protect and reduce such risks. Welding should be done when all the appropriate equipment has been worn. Welding companies should protect their workers against such hazards through the provision of the right protective gear.

Here are a few personal protective equipment for arc welding.


## Ear And Face Protection

### Helmets or Face Shields: 
For protection from radiation exposure, spatter, and sparks. The face shield should be fire resistant and have a filter lens. Never wear a face shield with broken glasses, as this will expose you to significant risks.

### Safety Glasses: 
It is worn to keep away dust and sweat. It also protects the eyes from extreme radiation and blindness.

### Earplugs: 
For ear protection against sparks and spatter from entering the ear, which can cause hearing loss. It also protects you from hearing loss, especially in noisy areas. The earplugs should be well fitted and flame resistant.

## Foot Protection

### Boots: 
Wear high boots that are steel-toed with rubber soles to protect your feet and ankles. Also, the long hours of standing in arc welding, the boots should be lightweight and broader at the toes for more comfortability.

### Leather Spats: 
Wear fire-resistant leather spats, especially in areas with massive sparks. Strap it on top of your pants and boots for prevention from injuries and burns.

## Hand Protection

### Gloves: 
The gloves should be flame resistant, insulated, dry, and hole-free. Welders' leather gloves are the recommended choice according to ANSI Z49.1. This is for protection from hazards such as burns, sparks, electric shocks, and radiation.

## Protective Clothing

The type of clothing to wear depends on the nature and the location of the workplace. The clothing should provide full-body coverage and be chemically treated to prevent from catching fire and radiation. The recommended clothing are aprons, overalls, and jackets.

Here are a few things to know about clothing in arc welding.

1. Avoid clothing made of synthetic materials due to high combustibility and melting, which cause severe burns to the skin.
2. Any clothing with holes or worn out edges or tears should be replaced. Such clothing exposes you to significant risks like radiation and burns.
3. Steer away from clothes with hanging pockets and cuffs. They may trap sparks and molten metals.
4. Wear long-sleeved shirts to protect your arms against burns and radiation.
5. Keep the clothes free of grease and oil as this may attract fires from the sparks.
6. Avoid tacking in your pants. The pants should extend past the boots.

In arc welding, it is essential to prevent hazards by wearing personal protective equipment. Every welder should wear a head to toe protective equipment for personal safety. Also, workers should be trained on how to protect themselves and how to use protective gear.
