As an electrician, it is your responsibility, and that of your employer's to ensure that you are having all of the protective equipment when at work. Personal protective equipment is referred to that equipment that is capable of providing any worker with protection capabilities against any hazard while at work. When getting this electrical protective equipment, you are supposed to know that they are all rated in a different manner since there are also different levels of electric current out there.

In case a worker might be operating on a site where the electricity is more powerful, the electrician will be forced to use more insulated protective equipment for the purpose of ensuring that the electrician is safe. In getting this protective equipment, an electrical worker is also supposed to ensure that he is very keen to avoid putting on the wrong protective equipment. Below are some of the personal protective equipment for all electrical workers.


## Safety Harness

This is one of the protective equipment that all electrical workers are supposed to use when they are operating at any greater height above the ground levels. The harness chosen is supposed to be a suitable one in relation to the intended application. That harness is also supposed to support that electrical work in the best and correct working position.


## Helmets

A Helmet is also considered as being one of the essential protection equipment that any electrician is supposed to be having while at work. Mostly this protective equipment is supposed to be used when an electrician is working on outdoor operations. The helmet ensures that the user is always safe from any kind of falling objects or collision from other solid objects on the head.

## Insulated Ladders

Having an insulated ladder will be of great help since in case of an accident, and the ladder gets in contact with a live wire, the electrician will still be safe.

## Voltage Detectors

Even after the power source has already been cut off, there are chances that there might still be electricity passing through the system due to the presence of capacitors. With a voltage detector, an electrical worker will be able to see if there might be any levels of electricity and if there might be, then he or she will avoid operation on that system until all of the power has been completely eliminated.

## Insulated Gloves

With these insulated gloves, any electrician will be protected against electricity from traveling into their hands when exposed to a live wire or short circuit.

## Goggles

While at work, you should not forget to protect your eyes completely from any hazard. With the right eye protection equipment, you will be able to prevent splashes or other hazardous fluids from getting into your eyes. In most cases, you will find that many people will prefer putting them on when they are washing the internal part of circuit breakers.

## Safety Footwear

Every electrician is advised to always put on safety boots or shoes incorporating a steel toe cap, and also, they should have non-slip soles to ensure the electrician is always safe.
