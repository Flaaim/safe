Of all the many tools we keep in our workshops and construction sites, the circular saw is easily one of the most impressive. They make light work of intricate cutting tasks, and can really speed up those lengthy DIY projects.

That said, no matter how experienced you are using a circular saw, you can never be too careful. The use of such a sharp and powerful tool so close to the hands and body is always a dangerous game. Thus, it's vitally important to take the necessary precautions to ensure a safe working environment. Here are the essential safety rules for using a circular saw. 

## Equipment/clothing

- Eye protection is a must - grab a pair of safety glasses.
- Ear protection is highly recommended.
- Wear a dust mask if dealing with harmful or nuisance dusts. 
- Avoid loose clothing, hair, jewelry, or anything else that can be pulled into the saw.

## Work area

- Make sure that your work bench or extension table is stable and secure, and that it will remain secure when pressure is applied to it. 
- Check that you clamps are in good nick, and that your stock will remain secure when cutting. 
- If you're using a corded saw, make sure all the cables are well out of the way of the cutting path.
- Check your cutting materials to make sure there are no obstructions such as nails and screws.



## Saw inspection (before plugging in/switching on)


- Check the sharpness of your blade. Sharper blades work a lot better, and are safer to use. 
- Make sure the retracting lower blade guard can move freely back and forth. 
- Check the blade for proper rotation.
- Make sure that the depth of the blade isn't set too deep. Only a quarter of the blade should extend below the bottom of your work-piece. The deeper the blade is set, the more likely it is to bind or kick back.
- Check that the blade-locking nut isn't too tight. 
- Make sure the safety switch, base plate, handles, and everything else are in good working condition.
- Make sure the motor is free of an accumulation of dust and chips.
- Make sure the upper and lower blade guards are free of sawdust. 



## When cutting


- Allow the saw to reach full rotation speed before starting the cut.
- Never take your eye off the saw.
- Stand to the side of where you're cutting to avoid dangerous kick backs.
- Don't overextend - plant your feet in a well balanced position close to where you're working.
- Always use both hands - one on the trigger switch, and one on the front handle. 
- Make sure that the waste side of the wood that you're cutting is free to fall away, while your keep side stays firmly on the table or work bench. 
- Don't force the saw if it comes up against significant resistance. 
- When you're finished with a cut, allow the blade to stop moving before setting it down on the work surface. 



## Changing/repairing parts


- Always consult the manual before replacing equipment. 
- Only change blades when the saw is disconnected from the power.
