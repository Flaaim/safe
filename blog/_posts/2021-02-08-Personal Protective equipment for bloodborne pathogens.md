## Hand protection

Gloves are a critical part of Personal protection when dealing with bloodborne pathogens because the hands are very active in managing medical procedures. The gloves should be thoroughly inspected to make sure there aren't any holes or rips. Many professionals will opt for two pairs of gloves just to be safe, and that's a wise decision considering it's not a perfect world.

Single-use disposable latex gloves are the type that should be used, but there are other material options such as rubber or nitrile. If you have any skin injuries then it would be a good idea to cover them with a bandage before putting gloves on. Even if it's the tiniest cut you should take the proper safety precautions to ensure you aren't exposed to bloodborne pathogens. This is especially important during the reigning pandemic. Additionally, Make sure they are secured at the end of the wrist and not loose.

## Protecting the face and eyes

The mouth, nose, and eyes are all danger zones for potentially getting a bloodborne pathogen in your body. There are so many entry portals for them that one needs to exercise extreme caution when utilizing safety equipment. Eyewear is the first order of business because your eyes are essentially giant targets for the tiniest spec of blood that can induce a potentially lethal medical situation. The eyewear ensures that no blood sprays into your eyes to cause major problems. Safety glasses or goggles can be implemented in a medical setting.

The nose and mouth are obvious danger zones too, so modern equipment leans towards the use of face shields so nothing is easily transmitted. Covering these channels of potential contamination is imperative in the medical field and should never be overlooked. Stores are also adopting this principle to reduce the transmission of illnesses only it's a simple body shield. Some may even implement oxygen suits in extreme cases where contamination is high risk.

## Full Body protection

Aprons and gowns are a specific type of PPE and are commonly used to keep fluids away from your body and clothes. People underestimate how easily bloodborne pathogens can be transmitted. If you're working around blood and a minuscule amount of it splashes on the clothes, then it can horrifyingly soak into them and through to the skin where if it's met with an open cut then it can transmit to your system and cause a host of issues. This is obviously not a situation anyone wants to be in which is why modern medical personal protective equipment has evolved and the standard is much higher to ensure the safest working conditions for all.

If you're around blood then you need to become fully acquainted with the importance of using these tools. Take an objective and focused application when implementing these effective precautions and your risk of transmission can be reduced dramatically. Nevertheless, accidents do still happen and one should keep that in the back of their mind and never get lazy with things like meticulous inspection of personal protective equipment.
