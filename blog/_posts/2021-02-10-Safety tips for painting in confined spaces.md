Everyone should be made aware of the dangers involved when painting in confined spaces. People can get seriously ill or even die if they are not careful, so it's important to avoid these hazardous situations whenever possible. To paint safely in a small area, here are five safety tips that must be followed:


## 1. Don't use spray paints

They release very harmful chemicals into the air and should never be used around a person's head or face. They also shouldn't be inhaled or ingested, which makes them very dangerous for both the person doing the painting and anyone else who might come into contact with them. It is best for all parties involved if you choose alternative methods of applying paint to your surface.


## 2. Open up windows and doors
If you're inside your house, try to find an open window or door that you can turn into your entry point for the paint. It is crucial that it is left open until everything has settled down after all of the painting has been completed. If there are no windows or doors near you, then look around for another area to work in, but remember not to take more than five minutes getting there because the smell will continue to get stronger every second longer you wait outside of a ventilated area. You should also try to avoid using fans if possible because they tend to blow any fumes towards other people who might be passing by on their way elsewhere, which also makes it difficult for everyone else who lives or works with them.


## 3. Wear gloves
They will protect your hands from harsh chemicals and paint splatters, which can lead to a variety of different infections if it is touched or ingested. Gloves also help to prevent you from accidentally wiping off the freshly applied paint when you touch any part of the surface that has already been painted. If, for any reason, you do get paint on your hands, be sure to use soap and water as soon as possible to wash it away before it begins to dry. Never try to remove paint that has dried by using gasoline or turpentine because it will only make the situation worse.


## 4. Do not light candles
Never light candles unless there's no other option but airflow within the area. They might seem like a good way to brighten up the atmosphere and make everything smell nice, but if you inhale enough of their fumes, they could lead to serious illness. Even though some people might find them romantic, they should never be used to make paint smell better during the painting process.


## 5. Wear an appropriate mask
As long as you stay in a ventilated area for at least five minutes before heading back inside, it will be okay for everyone else that lives or works with you if you wear a mask over your mouth and nose while painting indoors. It is the only way to block out all of those harmful crayon fumes so that no one gets sick from breathing them in by accident. If there is not enough ventilation at any time, then everyone should leave the house or building until it is safe to re-enter.
