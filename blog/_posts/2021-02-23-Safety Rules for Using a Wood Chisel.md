## Rules: Safe Use and the Wood Chisel

Some wood chisels may be smaller in size and they still have sharp blades. It is not hard to obtain a wound when safety practices are not in place. Anyone using this type of chisel ought to follow a set of safety rules and this applies to every size chisel. Adhere to the following rules and guidelines and expect to have a safe chisel experience:

- always wear a pair of safety glasses; this will protect your eyes from any stray debris or flying chips. A face shield will be added protection
- cover the chisel with a protective cap; a cap should cover the blade when it is not being used
- be sure it is correctly stored; storage spaces are important with any tool. Keep the side of the bevel up. All tools should be stored where children cannot reach them
- correct clamping is necessary; do not hold items in your hand. Learn how to securely clamp items because if it slips, the blade could pose safety threats
- make certain the handle is comfortable for use; often a smooth and rectangular handle works well. A chisel is used with hands only and it should be comfortable for a user
- the correct mallet will be needed; if you need to use a hammer or a mallet, make sure it has a bigger striking face. Use one that is solid or has a molded handle
- make certain the edge for cutting is sharp; a dull blade is going to be harder to control as compared to a sharp blade. A dull blade may ruin the quality of a project

## Added Tips
Do not use the chisel as a wedge or a pry because it is intended to be used for carving and wedging. It can be sharpened with a whetstone or a file. It is not a good idea to hold a workpiece on one hand and try to chisel with the other side of it. Safety should be a priority while using a chisel.
