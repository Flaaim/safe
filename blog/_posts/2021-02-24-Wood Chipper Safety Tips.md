If you're a person that has quite a bit of wooded area around your home and you like to spend a lot of time outside taking care of your land, then you probably would need to use a wood chipper to take care of removing much of the brush, and extra tree branches that seemingly come out of nowhere. It takes a great deal of care to operate such a wonderfully helpful machine, and it takes a great deal of discipline to stay safe when you're working with such a useful but powerful tool. When you decide that you need to use such a tremendous tool for your yard work, then please follow 5 safety tips.

Safety first. In order to do the job well, then you need to take care of yourself. The proper safety gear must be worn to make sure you are safe during the use of your chipper. Wearing safety goggles, a hard hat, gloves, and steel-toed boots are all personal protective equipment that will keep you safer than if you wore none at all. Be sure to wear clothing that stays close to your body so nothing can accidentally get in the wood chipper while it's running.

## Keep Hands Away From The Wood Hopper

This may seem like a no-brainer, but sometimes people get a little careless when they get too comfortable using a powerful tool like this one. You must always keep your guard up and be aware of where your body is in relation to the hopper at all times. It takes just one little slip to experience a life-changing accident.

## Never Have Children Near the Chipper While in Operation

This rule also seems like a bunch of common sense, but some people want to be kind to their kids and let them near to see what is going on. The sound of the chipper is mesmerizing itself, not to mention what is going on in the process, but the safety of children must be paramount, and they should never be let near the chipper while in operation.

## Be Aware of the Material You Put in the Chipper

Make sure that all material that you place in the chipper is intended for the chipper. Never place anything in there that shouldn't go in there. That's another safety issue, plus, it could permanently damage your chipper to where it would need replacing.

## Turn Off Power When Clogged

Clogs happen with wood chippers. When this occurs, you must turn off the chipper to unclog it. Never try to save yourself some time by trying to unclog it while it's running. That could lead to a devastating consequence.

Follow common sense safety tips when it comes to operating this incredibly useful and powerful landscaping tool. Taking care of you comes first, and your family will thank you for your care.
