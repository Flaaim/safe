With the Covid-19 pandemic being a new adjustment for the worlds day to day living and the way people can interact with one another, it is very hard to get used to such changes. The economy is suffering, people are losing jobs, and small businesses are closing with no future predictions of re-opening. There are your front-line workers like doctors and nurses who work tirelessly to make sure that people are being treated with the best care but other essential employees are overlooked. The waste handlers’ job may seem miniscule, but their work is needed and has been severely underappreciated.


With a pandemic threatening our very wellbeing, we must ensure that each person is properly protected at all costs. Waste handlers’ job is to do what most won’t do; get rid of the waste. Waste handlers need protection just like any other essential worker and requires extra protection since they are handling materials that were always considered hazardous, but now could be proven deadly. The need for personal protective equipment for them is in high demand and is needed to ensure the safety of these workers. The protective gear, clothing and the way the clothing should be worn is also essential. From ![dehs.umn.edu/63-personal-protective-equipment-ppe] stated that in order for them to remain safe when handling hazardous waste they must adhere to the following to ensure safety:


- Wear shoes closed to cover toes and heels
- Loose hair needs to be pulled back
- Protective gear and clothing must be snug fit(not too tight and not too loose)
- Full length skirts and pants to prevent any direct skin contact
- Cotton material
- Heavy duty gloves and protective facemasks and goggles
- Do not overfill
- Seal bags when ¾ full with tying or stapling
- Prior to use, check all safety equipment and clothing for signs of infection and structural integrity
- Do not share PPE equipment with anyone


The truth is, this type of job most people are not brave enough to endure. This type of job is often frowned upon. Where would our world be without these workers? Where would our communities be without these workers? Our neighborhoods, businesses, schools, etc., would be a mess. The people who are hired for these jobs are needed, appreciated, and help our communities to stay safe and clean. Making sure that they can work to their fullest potential is giving them the personal protective equipment needed to make their job easier for them, and making sure they return home safe to their loved ones. We have to make sure they have the necessary equipment to get the job done. Getting them protective gear, clothing, and creating safety measures can ensure these workers are working in a safe environment and can perform their job to their highest potential.
