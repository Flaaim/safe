Removing snow from your property once it stops snowing is an action most people take to ensure their safety and the safety of others. People who own a home or a business feel that it’s their responsibility to get rid of the snow as soon as possible. Since this is the way they think, and because failure to remove the snow within a certain number of hours can result in getting a hefty fine in some states, snow removal safety tips sometime get ignored.

Don’t close your eyes to these tips and don’t start shoveling snow before you know how to do it safely. Carefully read the following advice. Then proceed with caution.

## Things You Should Do

- Sprinkle rock salt or some other type of deicer on your walkways and steps before the snow falls to make removing the snow less troublesome later. Use one that isn’t harmful to animals if you can. According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, vomiting and diarrhea are common reactions to the ingestion of ice melt. The ingestion of too much ice melt by an animal can cause ulcers in and around the mouth, tremors and convulsions.
- Put on several layers of lightweight apparel before stepping outside to remove the snow. Wear a hat, tall water-proof boots that are slip resistant, thick socks, gloves and a scarf.
- Be sure to stretch before you start working.
- Use a broom made without metal to remove snow from your roof and avoid removing too much snow so you don’t damage your roof.
- Remove icicles carefully and protect your eyes by wearing goggles.
- Clear the snow from your gutters, downspouts and drains.
- Be careful not to damage electric and gas meters when you clean the snow off of them.
- Remove the snow from your dryer and furnace vents to prevent a fire or carbon monoxide poisoning. Also clear your natural gas appliance chimney of any snow if you have one, and clear the vent.
- Get out of the house immediately if you smell gas and call for help. Gas smells like rotten eggs.
- Take breaks and don’t rush to get the job done to avoid having a heart attack.
- Feel what your body has to say as you work and watch out for signs that may indicate you are having a heart attack.
- Call 911 without delay if you have chest pain.
- Only shovel snow that hasn’t hardened.
- Try pushing the snow instead of lifting it to avoid hurting your back. If you have more than one shovel, use the smallest one you have.
- Go to your state’s government website to find out if help with snow removal is offered. Some states will send someone to assist seniors and people with disabilities with removing the snow outside their homes.

## Things You Should Avoid Doing

- Do not shovel snow right after eating a big meal or after consuming alcohol. Avoid smoking when you shovel.
- Do not struggle to lift large amounts of snow at one time.
- Don’t bend at the waist when you lift the snow with your shovel. Bend your knees, squat, keep your back straight, then lift. Don’t keep your legs close together.
- Don’t twist your back when you shovel snow.
- Don’t do the work if you think the job is too big for you to handle. Having someone you know do it or hiring someone to shovel the snow could save you from injuring yourself and having a heart attack.
- After you start to shovel, don’t push yourself to finish the job if you get tired.
- Do not touch electrical wires.
- Don’t use a ladder to reach high places unless it is anchored securely and doesn’t have ice on it, and have someone who will hold the ladder steady for you while you’re on it at your side.
- Do not let the snow you remove from your roof land on any electric or gas meters as snow and ice can damage them.
- Avoid the risk of falling off the roof by not getting on it to remove the snow you see.
- Do not think about shoveling snow without asking your doctor if you can if you have ever had heart disease.
- Hold back from trying to melt the snow using electric heating appliances or a hot flame.

Use these snow removal safety tips to remove snow from your property in a safe way. Ensure your safety and the safety of others by following these guidelines. Get help if you need it.
