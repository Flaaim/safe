Some farm tasks involve handling hazardous materials and chemicals, hence should be done while wearing protective clothing. Farm workers carrying out tasks involving pesticides or agricultural chemicals should use personal protective equipment and clothing because of the danger posed by the materials.

## Personal Protective Clothing

You should wear protective clothing when handling various plant and animals materials. This is because you can infect open skin sores or cuts when you come into contact with animal waste, animals, soil or air-borne contaminants. Wear a long-sleeved shirt, long pants, and gloves while working. Bandage any scratches, cuts and open wounds when necessary to prevent exposure to bacteria or dirt that can contaminate the wound.

## Full-brimmed Hat and Goggles

Workers can also encounter problems when exposed to direct sunlight for long periods. You can reduce the risk of skin cancer by wearing a long sleeved shirt, a full-brimmed hat, and applying sunscreen to exposed body parts.

You should also put on goggles to protect the eyes from foreign materials and splashing chemicals. In some cases, safety glasses should have eye shields as they are more suitable when grinding or handling certain chemicals where full face protection is required to avoid splashing or flinging of particles into the face. However, you should not expect a face shield to protect your respiratory system.

## Dust Masks

Wear a dust mask for respiratory protection, which is designed to filter harmful particles before they reach your respiratory system. There are two types of dust masks; for screening non-toxic substances and the other for toxic substances.

The non-toxic dust mask protects against alfalfa dust, fiberglass, animal dander, and pollen. The one designed for toxic substances takes care of fungal spores and grain molds. Do not wear a dust mask while working in a silo or a manure pit as there is insufficient supply of oxygen. Instead, use a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), like the one used by fire fighters for adequate oxygen supply.

## Ear Plugs

Farmers and farm workers often suffer from hearing loss. Since most farm equipment are operated in the open, you should protect your ears by wearing ear plugs and earmuffs when working near or operating noisy machinery.

## Foot Protection

When handling pesticides, some may spill on your feet. In most cases, shoes and socks are enough protection, but certain pesticides require you to wear chemical resistant or waterproof footwear such as boots. It is advisable to wear bots that extend halfway up to the knee or past the ankles. When walking through or entering recently treated areas, wear waterproof boots if the spray is not completely dry.

In conclusion, it is important to protect yourself when working in the farm. Fatalities and lifelong illnesses have been reported because of accidents and chemical exposure in the farm. Visit a farm equipment retailer to purchase protective clothing for you and your workers.
