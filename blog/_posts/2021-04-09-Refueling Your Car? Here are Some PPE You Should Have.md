Personal protective equipment (PPE) is essential when refueling. They guard you against all hazardous chemicals you will come in contact with. It gives added protection in the event of an accident. By wearing protective equipment, it not only keeps you from harm but improves the efficacy of refueling. You cannot see or touch many hazards but by simply wearing your protective equipment; you are safeguarding yourself. Furthermore, protective equipment also prevents many accidents from happening. Below is a list of some types of personal protective equipment you can wear when refueling vehicles:

## Eye Protection
When you refuel your vehicle, whether at a gas station or home, chemicals can get into the eyes. If this occurs, the tissues of the eyes get irritated. Thus, wearing chemical splash eyes protective goggles keep all chemicals out.

## Hand Protection
As glasses protect the eyes, gloves protect the hands. Rubber latex gloves are chemical resistant with adequate protection from chemicals. They are not impenetrable; still, they limit exposure to the chemical during refueling.

## Head protection
Falls can lead to brain injuries. Falls are more likely to occur when chemicals such as gasoline and other fuels spill onto the floor. Spilling reduces the traction between boots and the walking surface, thus causing the person to fall. So, wearing a lightweight impact helmet shields the head in the event of a fall.

## Respiratory Protection
All fuels, especially those used in vehicles, contain a toxin called Benzene. Benzene is odorless chemical and highly flammable. Inhaling Benzene, whether through the mouth or nose, can cause breathing complications and existing asthma to flare up. Thus, a mask worn over the mouth and nose during refueling prevents the toxins' inhalation.

## Foot Protection
Equally important is wearing slip-resistant shoes when refueling. Slip-resistant shoes have rubber soles, grip, and traction that prevents slip and falls on oily or wet surfaces. So, whether you are at home or at the pump station, ensured your wear the correct shoes for your protection.

## Overall and protective apron
It is never safe to have fuel or chemicals on your clothes because most chemicals are highly flammable. So, wear an overall or apron should when refueling. The apron prevents the hazardous liquid from contaminating your clothing.

## Hearing protection
Wearing hearing protection, such as earmuffs and earpieces, is not mandatory but recommended. It is not compulsory because you need your ears to pick up any strange noise coming from your vehicle when refueling.

Gasoline and fuel are necessary but dangerous chemicals. Gasoline easily ignites, and fuel splash causes skin, eyes, and lung irritations. Thus, users of these chemicals must ensure their safety. Safety starts with protection, and protection begins with wearing personal protective equipment when refueling vehicles. They reduce the risk of harm or injury when working with hazardous chemicals. None of these personal protective gears provides absolution, but they act as your last defense in an accident. Also, protective equipment is cheap, easy to use, comfortable, accessible, and reusable.
