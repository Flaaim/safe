## What is a Manual Pallet Jacket?
Manual pallets have existed since 1918. It is the most basic type of forklift, and it is primarily used to move small loads. It is a four-wheeled trolley with a flat tapered fork designed to lift and transport small pallets horizontally around a personal storeroom. Typical manual pallet jacks are designed with a plump handle and lever used to raised and lower items. The manual pallets can hold up to 5000 pounds with a lifting height of 6 inches off the floor.


All manual pallet jacks are hand-operated with a hydraulic spring to lift the pallet off the floor. It is a simple, easy-to-use item that reduces muscle strain from lifting and moving heavy objects around. Additionally, manual pallet jacks are used mainly for moving short-distance items with a lifting height of 6 inches. It is used to handle basic inventory, such as moving objects in a grocery store and offloading small items at the docking stations.

## How to use a Manual Pallet Jack

These are the basic steps:

Step 1: Stand behind the pallet handle.

Step 2: Slide the flat tapered fork under the desired load.

Step 3: Then pull the lever downwards, and next, you pump the handle up and down. The hydraulic jack in that section will lift the fork off the ground, and you keep pumping until it is at your desired height.

Step 4: To lower the pallet back to the ground, you push the lever on the handle up, then squeeze, and that will automatically lower it to the ground.

## How to be safe while using a Manual Pallet Jack:

The most important thing when using any tool or equipment is safety. Although manual pallet jackets are easy to use, the equipment requires safe handling to prevent harm or injury. To ensure safe usage, follow these guidelines:

1. Since manual pallets have no brakes, the operation of the equipment must be at a controllable speed.

2. Pushing or pulling the pallet down or up a slope is not recommended.

3. Only one person can be on a pallet at a time; pallets are designed for one user at a time.

4. For balance and stability, always place the pallet in the middle of the item being transported.

5. Make sure the pallet isn't overloaded. A manual pallet will only hold items weighing less than 5000 pounds; if the weight of the items exceeds 5000, the pallet will topple.

6. Make sure you're using both forks to raise the load.

7. It is better to pull the pallet when it is loaded.

8. Keep the fork lowered to the ground when not in use.

9. If pallets are being used in a warehouse or loading dock, they must be parked in the traffic field. To avoid tripping hazards, park the pallet with the forks facing the wall if you're using it at home.

The unsafe use of a manual pallet jack can lead to many injuries, namely: foot injuries, back trauma, bruising, and shoulder strain. Therefore, safety should always be a user priority.
