Construction workers are some of the most vulnerable to workplace injuries. Let's explore the statistics, and safety tips to keep in mind when starting a new job.


The Bureau of Labor Statistics says that construction worker fatalities accounted for 4.7% of deaths on the job in 2017. This is an increase from 3% in 2016 and 2% in 2015. 


Construction sites can also be hotbeds for violence and discrimination due to their isolation from law enforcement or other authorities, which means these threats may be particularly present on construction sites compared to other workplaces that are more closely monitored by police officers or human resources officers



## 5 Important Safety Tips for construction workers:

### 1. Use proper safety harnesses and equipment

Construction worker fatalities are oftentimes caused by human error. When using power tools, it's essential to use safety harnesses and other equipment that will protect you from the power tool or vice versa. 


A safety helmet is vital to keeping your head safe. It also gives you a way to keep track of which direction the work area is facing. You can also use a neck strap or receiver for both lifting and carrying tools as well as construction materials.


### 2. Follow instructions closely


Construction facilities are inherently dangerous because of the hardworking nature of the job and the strict rules of what workers can do in these environments. 


Although you want to be independent and follow your own instincts, it's crucial that you follow instructions closely. If you are unsure how to proceed in a certain situation, ask your manager or a more experienced employee for help.


### 3. Report any concerns immediately


Most construction sites are known for their high turnover rate of employees, but there's a reason behind it: Sometimes conditions can be so bad that people won't stay on the job. 


Make sure that if you see something dangerous or potentially harmful to ask for help immediately. Don't work in silence if things feel unsafe - it's better to report your concerns than suffer an injury or worse due to neglect.


### 4. Use the buddy system


Another way to ensure that you are safe is to work with another employee. If you and a coworker travel to a construction site together, work together as closely as possible. 


It's better to be near someone than feel alone when working on an active construction site. You can also use your partner as a sounding board when there are concerns about your job or workplace.


### 5. Look for non-verbal cues from coworkers


It's important for everyone on the job site to be on the same page when it comes to safety, whether it's construction safety or other types of safety concerns. 


It's also smart to be constantly monitoring your coworkers' body language and use this as a form of non-verbal communication to see if they are stressed, angry, etc. Or just to notice when something feels wrong. 


Try to work closely with all the other workers on the site so that you can stay aware of each other's presence at all times.


What are some other tips for construction workers? Well, it is common knowledge that it is important to stay hydrated during a long construction day, but it is also important to pay attention to your own health as well. Being fit not only helps you avoid injuries, but it can also make you feel great about yourself and your body.
