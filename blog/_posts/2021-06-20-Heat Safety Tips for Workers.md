Abnormally high temperatures during summers can be pretty hazardous to workers who were working in an outdoor environment. The ideal and favorable temperature is 73 degrees Fahrenheit, but if you indulge in labor-intensive jobs, the appropriate temperature is 55 degrees Fahrenheit. 

Since extremely high temperatures can cause skin irritation and other medical conditions, it is intrinsic that workers adopt safety precautions to ensure they are safe.

## What are the Risks of High Temperatures?

Some of the acute signs of high temperatures include:

- Sunburns
- Heat cramps
- Heat exhaustion 
- Heatstroke
- Dehydration
- Tiredness
- Eye damage
- Fainting

Heat exhaustion and heat stroke are severe conditions and may require immediate attention. Heat exhaustion occurs when you lose too much fluid through sweating, especially in abnormally hot conditions. However, your body temperatures will remain constant in such a situation. Some of the significant symptoms include excessive sweating, weakness, and fainting. 

On the other hand, heatstroke is a more severe complication and occurs when your body temperature rises above 104 degrees Fahrenheit. This condition will cause symptoms such as confusion, seizures, nausea, and vomiting.

## What are the Major Safety Tips for Workers?

Whether working in an outdoor or indoor environment, ensure you incorporate the following safety tips:


- Drinking a lot of water: In extreme heat conditions, you will experience excessive sweating, and the body will lose a significant amount of water and electrolytes. Water is adequate to ensure you are hydrated. When working in hot temperatures, ensure you carry a bottle of water to replenish yourself. 
- Wear protective gears- scorching sun and direct UV rays can cause sunburns and heat cramps. To protect your skin from such disastrous effects, ensure you wear sunscreen after every two hours.
You can also protect your eyes from the harmful UV rays by wearing sunglasses when working in the outdoor environment. 
- Take adequate shade-ensure you take short breaks between the working schedules and take appropriate shade during those sessions. The shade allows your body to cool off appropriately and retain stable temperatures. 
- Install air conditioners or fans in the office-to minimize internal heat in the office environment, ensure you have a functional air conditioner or fan.
Management of Heat Exhaustion

After you suffer from heat exhaustion in the working environment, it is paramount to ensure you stay hydrated and take cover in a good shade. However, if the symptoms persist, you should ensure you seek medical attention immediately.

## Management of Heat Stroke

Heatstroke is a severe condition and may cause reversible and irreversible damage to your brain. If you withhold medical interventions for a prolonged time, death, permanent complications, or death may occur. A worker suffering from this condition should be given immediate first aid and taken to the hospital as soon as possible. The first step in first aid is cooling off the patient.

## Key Takeaway

When working in heat-intense environments, it is essential to hydrate and have a practical emergency plan if any worker suffers from heat-related problems. Ensure you are proactive in realizing and determining the significant warning signs for a heat-related situation and seek immediate medical assistance.
