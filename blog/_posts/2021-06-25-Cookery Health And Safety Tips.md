A kitchen is a place where most of us prepare foods in our homes. Knowing how to keep the place clean and applying all the necessary precautions can help you reduce those emergency visits to your doctor due to kitchen accidents.

The term cookery is used to denote all the activities involved in preparing food for consumption by use of heat. These activities greatly impact our health, as wrong preparation of food may cause food-borne illnesses.

This article summarizes cookery safety tips that will see you reduce if not completely avoid kitchen accidents during food preparation.


## Cookery health tips


These tips aim at reducing the risks of food contamination which may lead to food poisoning.

They include

### Washing hands
Washing your hands before handling any foodstuff in your kitchen is the most basic and effective way of maintaining contamination-free cookery. Use non-perfumed soaps and thoroughly wash your hands for at least 20-25 seconds under running water. This helps get rid of the disease-causing microorganism found on your hands.
### Chopping boards
Ensure that you clean the surface of your chopping board before and after using it. Using the same chopping board without cleaning it to cut different food products increases the risks of food contamination.
### Wash your ingredients
Before starting food preparation, ensure that you wash your ingredients thoroughly to remove any germs present.
### Cook your food thoroughly
Avoid eating undercooked food as it may contain microorganisms capable of causing severe illnesses to your body. Using a food thermometer will help you correctly estimate the right temperature that denotes fully cooked food.

## Safety tips you should put into practice in your kitchen

### Appropriate kitchen gear
Wearing the appropriate clothes and shoes while cooking will help you prevent a lot of kitchen accidents.
### Right shoes
Wear clean shoes to prevent contamination. Ensure your shoes cover your feet; this helps avoid burns and cuts caused by spills from hot water and oils and knives when they drop.
### Right cooking clothes
Avoid wearing baggy clothes with long sleeves; this will help prevent you from catching fire or even dropping your kitchen cutlery while in the kitchen. Instead, wear short-sleeved shirts or blouses and kitchen aprons that are heat resistant.
### Fire extinguishers
Kitchen fires mostly cause home fires. Having a functional fire extinguisher in your home and knowing how to use it will help you prevent losses and damages brought about by fire.
It's important to distinguish the different types of fire and how to extinguish them correctly. For example, a grease fire cannot be put out by water; instead, try covering the fire with a pan to cut off the air supply. You may also pour the baking powder for a quicker effect.
### Knives 
Use sharp knives while cutting or chopping up your ingredients, as this reduces the instances of hurting yourself compared to using blunt knives to cut up foodstuff in your kitchen. Using the right knives for the right job helps ease your job and prevents you from getting unnecessary cuts. Always ensure that you keep sharp knives far away from the reach of children.
### Enhance your life
Knowing and implementing correctly the cookery health and safety tips in your kitchen saves you the frustrations you may have to experience if the proper cookery precautions are not implemented. Refrigerating your food as soon as possible after purchase not only saves you the cost of buying other food products due to spoilage but also ensures that your family enjoys a healthy meal free from food poisoning.
