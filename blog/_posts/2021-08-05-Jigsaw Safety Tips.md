The jigsaw allows you to work on numerous materials - in addition to wood also plasterboard, synthetic material and even metal. The jigsaw is particularly suitable for recesses and curves. Its use is not difficult.

However, it is important to know what to observe for correct use and a satisfactory result while working in complete safety. Find out here important tips for using the jigsaw safely.

## JIGSAW: THE ESSENTIALS IN BRIEF

Jigsaws are universal tools, indispensable in any equipment of a good do-it-yourself hobbyist. Most jigsaws are powered by an electric motor, which is responsible for the back and forth motion of the blade. This movement is also referred to as oscillation. The jigsaw allows you to work materials of different hardness - just adapt the oscillation.

You can do this via an adjustment wheel. Today almost all jigsaws also offer a pendulum motion, also adjustable via a wheel: This movement allows the blade to perform a pendulum swing back and forth at the same time. All this facilitates cutting and involves a significant increase in power.

- Turn on the jigsaw before starting to work the piece to be treated.
- Switch off the saw during work breaks.
- Tighten the piece to be treated well to prevent it from slipping.
- Always grasp the jigsaw with both hands for control.
- Wear protective goggles and possibly work gloves.
- Make sure that the maximum cutting depth of the hacksaw is suitable for the workpiece. Otherwise, another type of saw is recommended, such as a plunge saw.
- Only remove the hacksaw when the blade has stopped moving.

## USING THE JIGSAW: FIXING THE BLADE

Many DIY hobbyists make a mistake: they use the wrong or dull blade. It is important not to work with dull or curved blades. Otherwise, in addition to compromising the result of the work, your safety is also endangered. Make sure that the blade is suitable for the material to be processed - for example wood, metal or synthetic material. Otherwise, you run the risk of unclean results.

Depending on the number of different materials to be processed, the blade needs to be replaced more often. Here's how to do it. The procedure for replacing a blade also depends on the type of your jigsaw. For this reason, it is essential to always have the instructions for use at hand so that you can consult them in case of questions and doubts. Here is an overview of the most important steps.

### Preparation

Disconnect the saw from the power first to work safely. In the case of a cordless jigsaw, just take out the batteries. After using the saw, allow it to rest for a while to allow the blade to cool down - otherwise, there is a risk of burns. Don't forget to remove the dust. You can use a toilet brush for this. Cut-resistant gloves are also recommended to protect against injury.

### Remove the old blade

Then carefully open the stop and remove all the brackets or safety mechanisms to extract the blade. Pull out the blade being careful not to let any dust get into the fastener. Otherwise, there is a risk that the new blade will not adhere well.

### Attach the new blade

Insert the new blade well into the appropriate housing. Then fix all the safety stops and brackets again, putting them back in their original place. The teeth of the blade must always point forward. Check the direction carefully before locking the blade. Once inserted, turn on the saw and make a test cut.


## JIGSAW: MAKE CLEAN STRAIGHT CUTS

It is not difficult to make a clean straight cut with the jigsaw. For example, straight cuts are particularly important for laminate cutting. It is necessary to use a blade as wide as possible, perfectly adapted to the needs of the piece to be treated.

The wider the back of the blade, the better the longitudinal guide and therefore the straight cut. Just as important is working without pressure: let the jigsaw take care of everything. Otherwise, there is a risk of fraying.

The use of a jigsaw with a guide is also recommended. This helps you to make a straight cut.
