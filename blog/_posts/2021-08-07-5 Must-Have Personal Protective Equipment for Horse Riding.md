One of the most enjoyable yet dangerous sport if not careful is horseback riding. Safe riding means avoiding injuries and remaining comfortable for maximum fun. Personal protective equipment when working with horses doesn’t guarantee ultimate safety, but they are essential in helping minimize injury severity

The most common PPEs for horseback riding include:

- helmets
- riding boots
- crash vests
- safety stirrups

These requirements are especially crucial for novice riders. Read on to learn more about them and their importance.

## Riding Helmets

One of the most crucial pieces of horseback riding equipment is a helmet. It is essential in protecting you from falling and injuring your head when riding a horse. Head injuries can be fatal, and sometimes riding a horse puts you at high risk of falling and hurting yourself.

While some people might argue that wearing a riding helmet is insignificant, there is a huge risk you will be exposing yourself to riding without one, no matter your age, skill, or training level. Avoiding head injuries might be a challenge, but that can be minimized by wearing a helmet. Therefore, consider an approved helmet whether you are horse riding for sports or fun

## Riding Boots

Other essential requirements for horse riding are boots, which are vital for several reasons. First, boots with smaller heels protect your feet from sliding through the stirrup. Secondly, they assist in offering protection and support should your toes get trampled. Tall boots, on the contrary, shield a rider's feet from chaff and scratches from branches or foliage when riding

## Safety Stirrups

There are various kinds of stirrups with different features that aid in boosting comfort, as well as protecting feet from sliding should you fall if your feet run through the stirrup during a fall, the chances of injuring yourself when the horse drags you are higher. However, safety stirrups prevent the chances of your feet jamming

## Crash Vests

Safety vests are paramount in offering protection to your torso in case of a fall. Crash vests are essential in injury prevention, especially to your spine, ribs, and internal organs. They have heavy padding but are lightweight. Typically, you will find crash vests worn by long-distance riders, speed game competition participants, and fun enthusiasts. You can also wear them under dressage clothing. if you are wearing them during hot months of the year, consider putting on a quick-dry top below the crash vest.

Crash vests also have various designs and colors you can choose from before buying the ideal one. For instance, there are crash vests with an air-triggered system if you are thrown off the saddle. Others are excellent for ATV, bike, and horse riding and might come with options for adult and children sizes

## Gloves

Finally, you will also require gloves when going for horseback riding. The primary purposes of gloves are to offer protection to your hands and enhance your grip, especially for pull horses. The last thing you need is blistered hands when horses pull along the trail or race track. 

Any correctly fitting pair of gloves is ideal, as long as you don’t have a problem holding the reins. You can go for leather-palmed gloves when riding in the summer or linen-palmed gloves for winter horse riding
