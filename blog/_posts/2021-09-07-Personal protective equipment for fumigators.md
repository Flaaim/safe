## Introduction.
Fumigation all has to deal with products that are harmful to the fumigator's health. Appropriate equipment is required in order to reduce the dangers of getting in contact with the pesticides. Personal protective equipment PPE refers to the devices and clothing that reduces the chances of a fumigator being exposed to the pesticides.
## Personal protective equipment

Personal protective equipment are made to protect several parts of the fumigator's body. For instance;
### 1.	Respiratory.
Respirators are made to prevent the fumigator from inhaling the pesticides. There are two types of respirators that exist;
#### Atmosphere-supplying respirators.
There are two specific kinds of atmosphere supplied respirators which are the 

- Self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA)

It is also referred to as compressed air breathing apparatus (CABA) or breathing apparatus (BA. It works independently from a remote breathing gas supply. It has a high-pressure tank of between 150-374 atmospheres, a pressure regulator, and an inhalation connection. There exist a frame that all these are mounted on and shall be used to carry all these. 

- Supplied-air respirator (SAR)

It is also referred to as an air-line respirator. Fresh air is supplied to the fumigator through an air hose. The advantage with SAR is that the fumigator shall not lack air due to the constant supply by the air hose unlike the SCBA where air is provided from the tanks which might be depleted. In some occasions, shortage of air can occur but SAR have an air pack up called auxiliary escape cylinder. This pack up provide the fumigator enough air to escape the danger zone. 

#### Powered Air-purifying respirators (PAPR)

It specifically designed to protect fumigators against contaminated air. This type of personal protective equipment has a headgear-and-fan assembly which performs three functions;

- Collects contaminated air.
- Eliminates a portion of the pollutant from the collected air.
- Delivers the purified air to the fumigator through his nose or mouth.

The PAPR has a mask which might be hard and tight thus providing a high level of protection but makes the fumigator uncomfortable. The mask can also be flexible and fit loose to the face of the fumigator. These masks are always reusable or even disposable. 

### 2. Skin

A fumigator requires gloves, gumboots, socks, long-sleeved shirt, and long pants to protect his skin during fumigation. Though some of the labels of liquid pesticides might not require gloves, it is always advisable to have them. Long sleeved shirts ensures that the hands do not get in contact with the pesticides. The socks are worn with the gumboots to ensure that the fumigator does not step on these harmful products. 

In addition to all these equipment, a fumigator can have a safety harness or a rescue belt. Also he can carry an emergency air-supply respirator especially if he is using a canister-type of respirator. 

## Conclusion.

Dealing with pesticides should be done with a lot of care. Allowing the pesticides to interact with your body can cause side effect such as irritation or perhaps even cancer. It is advisable for all fumigators to have all the necessary equipment before fumigation
