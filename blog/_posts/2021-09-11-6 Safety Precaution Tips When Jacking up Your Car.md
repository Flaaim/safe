Jacking a car isn't a strange phenomenon. For the most part, it's either changing a tire or brake inspection. Every year, automobile repair injuries continue to stack up due to the simple fact that people disregard the laid down safety procedures. There are some fundamental rules to follow when jacking up a car, and hopefully, once you are done with this article, you will be better informed. Let's dive in, shall we?


## Jacks are for lifting your car off the ground, not holding it in place.
If you have to crawl under your car, you must use a jack stand once you get it off the ground. You risk suffering severe life-threatening injuries or even death in the event your car pins you down. Unfortunately, many have passed through this route. It doesn't matter whether you are small-bodied; you will still need space to maneuver once under.


## Blocking Your opposite Wheels

Jacking up your car without blocking your wheels to prevent it from rolling poses a significant risk not only to you but to other road users. There are various options to achieve this; by using either metal wheel chocks, wooden wedges, or bricks. Always ensure that you block the opposite sides of the wheel to prevent your car from rolling away. Moreover, ensure you always carry your blocks with you in the trunk. 


If you have nothing to use in blocking the wheels, Park at the curb with wheels turned in. Though it may not protect you in case of a roll-off, innocent motorists won't have to contend with a runaway uninhabited vehicle.  


## Do Not Jack up Your Car on a Freeway/ Highway
Jacking a car on a freeway is akin to courting death. Not only is it a serious offense, but you may end up falling prey to carjackers too. This is where your phone call to a reputable towing company pays off. Always make sure you have their contacts at hand. In the absence of a cell phone, hang a white piece of paper or white rag on your driver's side as you wait for the highway patrol.


## Ensure a Level Ground Before Jacking up Your Car
It may prove problematic to coast down a hill in case of a flat. You could still park your car and face the wheels towards the curb while blocking your wheels. However, such precautions won't alleviate the risks associated with changing a tire on a slope. If you cant, get to level ground or wait for assistance, change the tire at your own risk. 


## Never Jack up Your Car With Someone Inside
The simple reasoning behind this is that we don't want or need any extra weight, particularly if you will get under. 


## Use the Appropriate Vehicle Jack Points
Always ensure that you place the jack at the appropriate jack points. It will not only ensure that you minimize the risk of the vehicle crashing down on you, but you will also minimize damage to your car's body. 


## As we conclude,
Simple safety procedures such as the ones mentioned above ensure that you not only look out for yourself but other road users too. We hope that this article empowers you even more to make sensible future decisions.
