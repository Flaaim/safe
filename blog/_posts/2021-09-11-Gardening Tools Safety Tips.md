## Gardening


Gardening is an art and can do wonders for our well-being. With its many benefits, more people are now venturing into gardening.


However, we should not disregard taking proper precautions in protecting ourselves and the people around us while gardening.


Meanwhile, hospitals admit more than 400,000 outdoor garden tool-related accidents each year.


It doesn't mean that we should stay away from gardening. We only need to take extra care and observe proper safety procedures to avoid injuries and damages.


Ignoring product manuals, safety measures, and using the wrong gardening tool for the job are the most common causes of gardening injuries.

Before you start picking up your tools and stepping outside, make sure to check out these gardening tools safety tips:




#### Always wear gardening or rubber gloves.


Always wear gardening gloves to protect your hands against cuts, skin irritants, insect bites, and soil. Meanwhile, leather gloves are protection against puncture injuries from insect bites and thorns.


In using garden chemicals, always use rubber gloves. Before doing so, make sure that there are no holes or tears.




#### Use gardening tools with safety devices, such as safety guards.


When purchasing tools like shears, loppers, or pruners, look for brands featuring a safety lock. This feature may easily be disregarded, but it is an essential feature of every tool. It generally prevents accidents.




#### Read and follow the manufacturer's instructions on the proper use of the equipment.


It is necessary to read manual guides provided by manufacturers to understand how to best use product features. The same goes for gardening tools. The manual guides contain complete details about the tool that are not readily available anywhere else. 


Manuals or guides inform consumers about tools specifications and assembly instructions. Even with the help of internet, consumers may not easily understand how to properly assemble or operate a product without the manual guide. 


#### Check your tools regularly to make sure they are in good working condition.


Prevention is still always better than cure. One way to prevent accidents and injuries is to make sure that your tools are not malfunctioning.




#### Clean your tools regularly.


Regular oiling and cleaning of your tools are required to prevent rust, allow the handles to stay strong, and keep them sharper. Properly maintained quality garden tools are comfortable to use and can last for generations.




##### Choose the appropriate hand tools to suit you.


Avoid using or buying hand garden tools that feature molded' handles that don't fit your hand. Calluses, blisters, and muscle pain can occur if your finger grips on the handle are too small or too large for your hand.

Instead of digging with your fingers, use appropriate tools for digging (for example, a hand shovel).

Aside from your garden tools, you should also be physically ready. Gardening can overuse injuries and cause back pain. A light warm-up and stretching before doing the work can go a long way in keeping you healthy and safe.

Practice these safety tips and continue to enjoy gardening as a relaxing and enjoyable activity.
