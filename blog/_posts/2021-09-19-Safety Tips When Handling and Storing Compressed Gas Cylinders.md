Compressed gas cylinders mostly contain gasses such as helium, hydrogen, and nitrogen. Safety precautions instituted when handling these compressed gas cylinders can protect you from accidents caused by mishandling the cylinder. Below are some safety tips on how to handle and store compressed gas cylinders:

## 1. Safety gloves should always be worn whenever handling compressed gas cylinders

Safety gloves will protect your hands against cuts and bruises since most compressed gas cylinders have sharp edges, which can cause injury if mishandled. Safety gloves also prevent dryness and cracks in the skin, especially for those working with oxygen or acetylene tanks which contain water-based chemicals like sodium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide, respectively, which can cause drying up of the skin upon contact. Safety gloves made of leather or fabric should be used and not latex gloves.

## 2. Safety glasses should also be worn when handling compressed gas cylinders 

This is because there is a possibility that compressed gas cylinders will explode and break upon mishandling. Safety glasses protect your eyes from chemical reactions and flying metal fragments that may cause harm to your vision. Safety goggles are the best type of eye protection as they cover most parts of the face, including the ear, nose, and temple parts. Safety goggles made of plastic such as PVC will protect you from chemicals such as ammonia and chlorine-based fluids enclosed in compressed gas cylinders which can damage your cornea upon contact with the eyes.

## 3. Always secure compressed gas cylinder caps with clamps or screw rings before moving them around on carts or trucks. 

Safety clamps should be used to bind the compressed gas cylinder's nozzle and valve parts to prevent the release of contents from the compressed gas cylinders when accidents such as collisions occur. Safety screws rings are made out of steel and can be easily attached or detached from each other depending on your requirement. Safety screws rings do not loosen over time, unlike safety clamps, so there is no need to regularly check if they are tight enough for safe transport of compressed gas cylinders through carts and trucks.

## 4. Always use a regulator when working with compressed air or gases to reduce the risk of injury.

 Injuries may arise due to due to accidental release of compressed gas contents upon mishandling during transportation, storage, and usage in the workplace. Safety regulators help you monitor flow rates by displaying reading about the amount of compressed gas being dispensed. Safety regulators should be combined with a hose or piping to avoid direct contact with the compressed gasses, which can cause harm due to its high pressure and toxicity. Safety regulators are available in different sizes suitable for different quantities of compressed gas cylinders, so it is important to select one according to your needs.

## 5. Safety relief valves should be installed on any compressed gas cylinder system

Safety relief valves should be installed on any compressed gas cylinder system where there is a risk of building up too much pressure from contents that may be highly flammable and reactive such as acetylene and other petroleum gases like ethylene, propylene, and butane which requires releasing excess pressure through safety relief valves. Safety release valves should always be calibrated properly before use to avoid any leakage, which can cause harm to the surrounding personnel and equipment and the environment at large. Safety relief valves should be regularly checked for leaks if equipped with a pressure gauge to determine how much excess pressure has been released from the compressed gas cylinders through safety relief valves.
