Have you ever wondered how working on people's vehicles feels like? One of the most rewarding, not necessarily externally but internally rewarding job is fixing people's vehicles. As human beings, we usually are motivated by a purpose higher than ourselves. While the job is really interesting, there are some safety precautions that the staff must follow at all times. This helps in protecting them from accidental injuries. Below are some of the safety rules that every staff or employee of an Automotive shop must follow.

## a) Never Smoke in or Around Repair Garages

While smoking is not illegal in most countries, there are areas where you shouldn't step in with cigarettes. Even though it might not be a government law, going with cigarettes around a garage will be detrimental to your own health.

Normally, vehicles contain highly flammable fluids. Thus if a person walks in with such places with cigarettes, the vehicle will be easily set on fire, especially if ash from the cigar comes into contact with the vehicle. And this is very likely. I mean, imagine if the person smoking is the one working on your vehicle?

## b) Always Keep the Working Area Tidy

Each tool should have its own cabinet. This will allow you to easily access the tools in case you need to use them. Therefore, after each day's work, keep each tool in its cabinet. Moreover, this allows you to have a clear walkway, and thus, commencing the following days' work becomes easy.


## c) Put on Tight Clothing and Always Avoid Torn and Ripped Clothing

Working on vehicles involves handling even the tiniest parts of the vehicle. Some of these parts are very delicate. Wearing torn clothes may spoil some of them.

When working, the torn parts may accidentally get into oily containers. Unknowingly, if you handle other parts of the vehicle using the same outfits, they may smear oil on software parts on the vehicles, thus spoiling the parts. Therefore, you should discourage employees from putting on unacceptable outfits. They should obtain customized uniforms from qualified companies.

## d) Put on Your Protective Gear at All The Times

This includes sunglasses, gloves, and ear protection equipment. Though some protection equipment should be worn at specific times, some like gloves and overalls should be worn at all times while repairing a vehicle.

Some vehicle parts are really oily. Without protective clothing, some oil droplets may contact your body, thus being detrimental to your health.

## e) The Battery Should Always be Disconnected While Working on Electrical Systems

Do you know why you should do this? It's because, if connected while working on a vehicle, the battery may cause some current loss. Moreover, keep off the engine while it's running. If hands, tools, or other objects are placed on the engine while it's running, it may be detrimental to the person.

## f) Unless Properly Supported, Never Work Underneath a Vehicle

There have been instances in the past where vehicles had fallen on those working on them in the automotive repair shop. This is usually caused by not supporting the vehicle properly. To ensure stable support on the vehicle, verify that the vehicle is very stable and that no risk exists of the vehicle falling. Even while planning on building an automotive repair shop, keep these safety rules as your guide.
