Gas stoves are more convenient, energy-efficient, and durable than most cooking equipment. They are relatively safe appliances when they are installed and maintained correctly. However, you must be extra cautious when using your stove to avoid potential risks and injuries. For your safety and your family, ensure you consider the following tips when using this kind of cooking equipment at home.

### Never Leave the Equipment Unattended


An open flame can quickly start a kitchen fire that can cause significant damages to your home. To prevent accidents while using your stove, never leave the equipment's gas flames unattended. When you delay lighting up the stove, ensure to turn off your burner and wait for approximately 15 minutes before turning it on afresh.

### Scrutinize the Gas Line for Possible Leaks


When natural gas in the stove is freely exposed to air, it produces a smell similar to that of a rotten egg. When there is a leak on your cooking appliance, you can smell it through the smell similar to rotten egg it produces. In the event of a leak, you should seek help from your area's professional gas plumber. However, before you call an expert, ensure to do the following:

- Turn the gas burner off to cut the gas supply
- Shut down all electrical and gas appliances in your home
- Open the windows and door to allow ventilation
- Extinguish any naked flames

However, if you notice it is unsafe to perform the above, evacuate the place immediately and contact your local fire department.

### Maintaining Your Stove


Just like other cooking appliances at home, the stoves also require routine maintenance to ensure they provide a hassle-free and long functional life. The best way to maintain your stove is to clean it daily. After you're done cooking in your kitchen, remove the heavy grates and burners to allow them cool. Use a sharp object like a toothpick to remove any food debris out of the burner's holes. Wash the grates and burners with soapy water.

## Conclusion


A gas stove is an outstanding appliance in your home since it offers an excellent cooking experience as long as you take proper care of it. Provided you follow all the necessary safety precautions while using your stove, you can use the cooking equipment for many years with no difficulty.
