### Study the Safety Features of Your Compressor

First, learn about the safety features of your compressor to make sure that it is certified with the appropriate certifications and marks. Use an OSHA-approved nozzle for safety. Use a self-retracting cord when operating any compressed air tools.

### Wear Personal Protective Equipment

Second, wear safety goggles and gloves when using any tool, especially those that use compressed air. Use gas air compressors outdoors. When working on or near machinery, use a face mask and gloves. For your protection, protect your eyes with safety glasses. For safety's sake, don't operate the compressor if the flame or spark in the tool creates a cloud of dust or debris.

### Follow All of Osha's Guidelines

Third, follow OSHA's safety standards and regulations at all times. Wear safety equipment at work. Wear a dust mask if there is a chance the tool will create a large amount of dust. If you are going to be using the tool during travel, carry a dust mask with you.

### If you are Unsure, Ask a Someone

Fourth, ask someone who is trained to use the compressor about its operation. It may be a good idea to take the compressor for a test drive to make sure that it isn't damaged or doesn't need repairs. It may also be wise to bring a friend if you can when operating a compressor.

### Keep Your Compressor Clean

Fifth, keep your compressor clean. You should clean it after each use, whether it makes a loud noise or not. Use compressed air cleaners, if available, to remove build-up and dust from the nozzle. Also, you may want to consider purchasing a compressor oil or fluid. This will help keep your compressor running smoothly.

By following these safety precautions when using an air compressor, you will be ensuring that you and your coworkers remain safe. Remember, your safety comes first! If you don't feel comfortable doing the job, don't do it. Your health and safety are not something to be taken lightly.

When choosing an air compressor, make sure that you choose wisely. Know what the compressor does. Learn about how it works so that you can assess whether the product is right for you. If you have any questions, talk with someone in the safety department at your local hardware store. They are there to help you!

These safety tips are just some of the things that you can do to stay safe when using handheld air compressors. Always follow the manufacturer's directions. Do not operate the device in an area where there are excessive vibrations. Read all of the safety data sheets that come with your unit.

And above all, practice safety every time you use the product. Wear safety gear if you can. Use caution when moving the compressor from one location to another. Wear gloves when operating the tool. Avoid dropping the compressor by making sure that it is not in any way hanging on a hook. Follow all safety precautions carefully and you will not have an accident.
