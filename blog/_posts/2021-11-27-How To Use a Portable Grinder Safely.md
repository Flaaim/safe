Having a portable grinder is a great tool to have when you need to polish, grind, or cut material. In fact, having this multipurpose tool allows you to accomplish many jobs when you have the correct wheels to use for a specific task. A few of these tasks involve wood sanding, cutting metal, concrete, or stone, and paint removal.

In order to begin working safely with your portable grinder you need to ensure that your work area is clean, that you have the correct wheel, have checked the guard and wheel, and performed a test on the grinder's wheel.

Once you have the above accomplished, you will need to ensure that you wear protection as soon as you get started.

Prior to using the grinder, make certain that the grinder guard is properly placed in the middle of the grinder wheel and person operating the grinder.

Adjustment of the guard should be simple, and permit you to make necessary adjustments. Prevent others from standing close as you conduct grinding work.


Utilize Safety Protection

It is advised to always have safety protection in use as you are grinding. Items for safe use include protective goggles and face shield in order to prevent debris from flying into your face. Try to keep clothing tight fitting and not loose, remove dangling jewelry, and secure any long hair. Assess the job for any other protection that you may need such as ear plugs or gloves.

Design the space you plan to work in and situate it without having to reach much while you are grinding and are able to keep your feet planted and remaining balanced. You should also be firmly positioned so that you remain focused on the job at hand. As you grind, ensure that both hands are used to grasp your grinder.

After making sure that your portable grinder´s new wheel is mounted, you should have it run at normal speed for at least a minute prior to it being used for a grinding job and then proceed to use the full amount of speed as you are grinding. Make certain that you have a safe, smooth operation and the grinder is free of any vibrations. Keep the pressure at a minimum for the wheel. If any vibrations or sounds are heard, disconnect your grinder and perform a second test to resolve your problem.

Once the power is off, make sure the wheel is no longer spinning before placing the grinder on the surface of your work area. After completing your work, unplug the grinder and proceed to clean your work space and remove debris caused by the grinder.

When grinding a job, a vise should not be used in order for small material to be grinded.

Your grinder should be away from any material which may cause a flame from a spark.

Ensure that your wheel is always dry and not damp, and discard if so. If you are missing a disc label, then you should not use the grinder.

Besides being safe during operation, you should also take care if your grinder is electric to ensure the power cord is in good condition.

Your grinder´s cord needs to be secured to prevent it from getting in the way during use. Ensure that the plug is pulled and not yanked as it is removed from the plug outlet.

Keep your portable grinder secured with a hook or rack and not on doors. Keep wheels stored in dry areas that are moisture and humidity-free.

You can ensure continuous safe use by keeping the grinder cleaned and lubricated. When changing parts out, make sure you adhere to the recommendations set by the manufacturer.
