The use of agrochemicals in agriculture is increasingly important and will continue to grow in the future. However, many misconceptions are surrounding these chemicals - both among the general public and among farmers themselves. This blog post aims to provide a well-informed consumer's guide to the safe use of agrochemicals that will help you understand what they are, how they are used, their benefits, risks associated with their use, and ways to minimize risk when using them.

## What are they?

These are chemicals that farmers use in agriculture to increase the productivity of food products. Also called crop protection products, they include herbicides, insecticides, fungicides and more.

Farm chemicals are applied for pest management to improve crop yield and quality. Before a farm chemical is used, the farmer must first ensure that they have a problem that the chemical can solve. Farmers must also consider if their target pest(s) are susceptible to specific chemicals at the time of application. The frequency and rate of application will depend on pest infestation levels, crop sensitivity, environmental conditions, etc. They are extensively used nowadays because they help minimize the negative impact on the health of farmworkers and consumers and also reduce costs associated with the production of food.

Farm chemicals fall into two main groups: contact and systemic. Contact chemicals kill plants when they come in direct contact with them, while systemic chemicals are absorbed by plants and transported to all plant parts (leaves, roots and fruit), where they kill the pests.

## Storing and Handling Agrochemicals

Farm chemicals should always be used as per instructions on the product label. Instructions include limitations on which pesticides can be used in combination with each other, how long to wait between application of different chemicals, storage conditions and more.

They are commonly supplied in metal or plastic containers. These containers must be kept in a locked storage area and out of the reach of children to avoid accidental poisoning.

When transporting farm chemicals, always use a secure, covered container. Remember that the product label is the law - so follow all instructions on the label carefully. These must be stored properly to prevent damage, thus minimizing the risk of occupational accidents.

The label on the container indicates how it should be stored (e.g. in a cool, dark place; at room temperature), which chemicals can or cannot be stored together, etc. The container must be marked with all relevant information for users (such as the product's unique identification number) and kept out of reach of children. When using or transporting them, always follow the safety instructions on the product label.

## Safety Precautions Working with Agrochemicals

Important, when handling farm chemicals, it is essential to take safety precautions. In general, you should always:

- Wear protective clothing, including gloves, goggles and a mask
- Handle farm chemicals in a well-ventilated area
- Keep farm chemicals away from children and animals
- Store farming chemicals in their original containers and away from food
- Wash your hands immediately if you get any chemicals on them
- Dispose of empty chemical containers properly by returning them to a dealer or taking them to a recycling centre.

Be informed about the different risks associated with each crop protection product you use, and follow all label instructions when using them.
