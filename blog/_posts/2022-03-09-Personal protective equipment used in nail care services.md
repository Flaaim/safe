When it comes to nail care, you need to be safe and effective. That's why it's important to know the different types of personal protective equipment (PPE) used in nail care services. PPE is anything that helps protect you from harm while you're working. It can be anything from a safety mask to a hard hat. Choosing the right PPE for the job is important, and this guide will help you do just that.

## Various types of Personal protective equipment used in nail care services:


Face shields - A face shield is a kind of facial covering that fits over your head and nose. Several different styles are available, including ones designed with an elastic band around the forehead to keep them securely in place. They cover all but the area around your mouth; this makes them easier to breathe through than regular masks. They're especially useful for people who need to apply multiple coats of polish without being hit by spray mist while wearing their safety glasses.

Hand sanitizer - Hand sanitizers have become pretty essential in recent years due to increasing concerns about spreading COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization recommend frequent hand washing to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, including COVID-19. In some cases, especially at businesses where you may be required to shake hands, using alcohol-based hand sanitizer may offer further protection from contracting the virus.

Work Boots - Work boots offer excellent protection for feet and ankles. They're also great for preventing slips and falls since you never know when an opportunity to fall arises. Your best bet when selecting a pair is to find ones with rubber outsoles, heavy-duty soles and steel shanks. A steel shank offers strength and durability, while the rubber sole acts as shock absorption when you impact the ground with steps. To avoid slipping and falling over objects that can be seen at the bottom of stairs and ramps, look for boots with low heels or a non-skid design.

Face masks - Masks provide added protection from droplets of respiratory fluids. Ideally, choose a mask type that does not cause allergies or irritation. Avoid those worn by others because this could transfer germs to you. If you already have asthma, contact allergy, sinus issues, etc., make certain your face mask doesn't aggravate them further. Also, be wary of any face masks made of cotton, polyester or nylon and stick with materials that help filter out harmful contaminants like dust mites.

Goggles - Goggles are not only useful for protecting your eyes from splinters but can also prevent contamination from splashing liquids onto your face. You'll want goggles that wrap around your head and feature clear lenses to ensure visibility during work hours. Consider choosing goggles that include side shields if your job entails working outdoors.

Hands gloves - Gloves protect against cuts and abrasions on your fingers, palms and knuckles. Wear gloves whenever you need to handle delicate products or apply lotion/cream. As always, check the labels before putting anything on your hands.
