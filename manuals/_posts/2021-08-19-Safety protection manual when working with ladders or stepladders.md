## General requirements

This Instruction provides for basic labor protection requirements for workers when working with ladders

When working with ladders, an employee may be exposed to the following dangerous and harmful production factors:

- work at height;

- moving parts of equipment, tools;

- sharp edges, burrs and roughness on the surfaces of equipment and tools;

- a dangerous voltage level in an electrical circuit, the closure of which can occur through the human body;

- increased or decreased air temperature of the working area;

- increased air mobility;

- high air humidity;

- increased dust and gas content of the air in the working area;

- increased level of noise and vibration at the workplace;

- insufficient illumination of the working area;

- physical and neuropsychic overload.

When working with ladders, an employee is provided with overalls, safety footwear

When working with ladders, an employee notifies his immediate supervisor about any situation that threatens the life and health of people, about every accident that occurs at the workplace, about the deterioration of his health, including the manifestation of signs of an acute illness

When working from ladders, the worker must:

- perform work that is within his duties or assigned by the administration, provided that he is trained in the rules for the safe performance of this work

- use safe work practices

- be able to provide first aid to victims

- know the location of primary fire extinguishing means and be able to use them

When working from ladders, it is necessary to comply with the requirements of this manual, as well as the requirements of the instructions of the manufacturers for the operation of the applied protective equipment, tools and equipment to ensure protection against the effects of hazardous and (or) harmful production factors associated with the nature of the work.

If you find any malfunctions in equipment, fixtures, tools and other deficiencies or dangers in the workplace, immediately stop work.

## Requirements before starting work

Wear personal protective equipment. Do not pin clothes with pins, needles, do not keep sharp, fragile objects in clothing pockets.

Prepare the workplace for safe work

- inspect it, remove all unnecessary items, without cluttering the passages;

- check the approaches to the workplace, evacuation routes for compliance with labor protection requirements;

- check the adequacy of the lighting of the workplace;

- check that there are no hanging bare wires;

- check the reliability of closing all current-carrying and starting devices of the equipment;

- check the condition of the working platform (no potholes, irregularities, spilled liquids, etc.);

- check the availability of fire-fighting equipment, first aid kit;

- establish the sequence of operations.

Check the condition and serviceability of the ladders

When inspecting wooden stairs, check their compliance with the technical requirements for the condition of the wood. When inspecting metal stairs, you should make sure that there is no deformation of the nodes, cracks in the metal, burrs, sharp edges, violations of the fastening of steps to the bowstrings. The knees of the sliding ladders should slide out and out smoothly, and securely lock at any given height. When the rubber shoes wear out, the latter must be replaced; blunt tips must be sharpened.


The design of ladders and ladders should exclude the possibility of shifting and overturning them during operation. Ladders and stepladders should be fitted with sharp points on the lower ends for installation on the ground. When using ladders and stepladders on smooth supporting surfaces (parquet, metal, tiles, concrete), shoes made of rubber or other non-slip material should be worn at the lower ends.

When installing a ladder in conditions where displacement of its upper end is possible, the latter must be securely fastened to stable structures

Installation of stairs on the steps of flights of staircases is not allowed. To perform work in these conditions, use other means of paving.

When working with a ladder in places with heavy traffic of vehicles or people, to prevent its fall from accidental shocks (regardless of the presence of tips at the ends of the ladder), the place of its installation should be fenced or an additional worker must be posted to warn of the work. In cases where it is impossible to secure the ladder when it is installed on a smooth floor, a worker in a helmet must stand at its base and hold the ladder in a stable position.

All detected faults in ladders, stepladders, equipment, tools, electrical wiring and other faults should be reported to your immediate supervisor and start work only after they have been eliminated

## Requirements during work

Perform only the work for which you have been trained

Do not allow untrained and unauthorized persons to work

Work only in good working clothes

Be attentive, careful and not distracted by extraneous conversations

Use serviceable equipment, tools, devices necessary for safe work; use them only for the work for which they are intended

It is prohibited to work with faulty equipment, tools and devices, as well as personal and collective protective equipment.

When working at height, it is not allowed to work on ladders without appropriate safety systems for working at height

- over rotating (moving) mechanisms, working machines, conveyors;

- using electric and pneumatic tools, construction and assembly guns;

- when performing gas welding, gas-flame and electric welding works;

- when tensioning the wires and for supporting heavy parts at a height.

When using an access ladder or stepladders, it is not allowed:

- work from the top two steps of ladders that do not have railings or stops;

- be on the steps of a ladder or stepladder for more than one person;

- raise and lower the load along the ladder and leave the tool on it;

- install ladders at an angle of more than 75 Â° without additional fixing them in the upper part.


When moving the ladder by two workers, it must be carried with the tips back, warning oncoming about the danger. When carrying the ladder by one worker, it should be in an inclined position so that its front end is raised above the ground by at least 2 m.

It is forbidden to lean ladders on the glass

 Do not fold the tool near the edge of the platform, or throw it and materials on the floor or on the ground. The tool should be stored in a special bag or box

When lifting and descending from a height, it is forbidden to hold the tool and parts in your hands, they must be lifted and lowered on a rope, cable or in bags over your shoulder

It is forbidden to throw any objects for feeding to the worker at the top. The feeding should be done using ropes, to the middle of which the necessary items are tied. The other end of the rope should be in the hands of the worker standing below, who keeps the objects being lifted from swinging

Hazardous areas for finding people should be fenced and have warning labels.

During operation, ladders and stepladders must be cleaned of debris, and in winter - cleaned of snow and ice and, if necessary, sprinkle with sand

Carry out work only if fences, interlocks and other devices that ensure labor safety are available and in good working order, with sufficient illumination

Do not touch moving mechanisms and rotating parts of the equipment, as well as energized live parts of the equipment

When working from ladders and stepladders, the employee is prohibited from:

- use faulty tools, devices, as well as tools and equipment, the handling of which he is not trained;

- to carry out work without using the necessary PPE;

Take off the overalls, put them in order and hang them in the place designated for their storage.

Inform the work supervisor about all faults and shortcomings noticed during work
