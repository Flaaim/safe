It has been estimated that there are 6 million cars on the road for business reasons. The Department of Transport has suggested that half of those will be involved in an accident every year.

As a conscientious employer whose work involves considerable travelling, <> (“the Company”) is committed to reducing the risk of work related road traffic crashes and collisions.

We understand that the following legislation applies to us:

-Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 
-Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 
-The Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992 
-Road Traffic Acts supported by the Highway Code 
-UK Domestic Drivers’ Hours Rules 
-Tachograph Regulations 
-The Road Transport (Working Times) Regulations 2005 
-The Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1996 
-Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007

This Driving Policy applies to all staff members and Directors who drive in connection with Company employment whether it is in their own vehicle, a fleet vehicle or a vehicle hired by the Company.

This Policy will be given to all staff members who drive on Company business.

The purpose of this Policy is to set out how the Company will ensure that all those who drive on Company business are acting in line with the both Health and Safety Law and Road Traffic Legislation.

This Driving Policy will be reviewed / updated as needed annually, and any changes made known to all driving staff.

All staff who drive on Company business whether they use a company vehicle or their own, will be required to produce their Driving Licence every six months, or on request, to prove continued entitlement to drive the class of vehicles they are required to use. All drivers will be deemed to have consented to permit their employer to contact the DVLA to check for any endorsements every six months or if unsafe driving practices are suspected.

Failure to produce the driving licence when requested may result in disciplinary action being taken.

Employees are required to inform their line manager of any Road Traffic Accidents (RTA) involving Company vehicles as soon as it is safe to do so, whether or not any damage is sustained to the Company vehicle. All staff are required to follow the procedures set out in sub-clause 9.6.

All employees must inform their line manager of any driving penalties either received or pending within 5 working days of notification

## 1. Parking Tickets/Fines

If parking tickets are given to any Company vehicles whether or not they are being used for Company business, the driver/keeper of the vehicle is to ensure that the office is informed as soon as reasonably practicable. Failure to do so may result in the employee being held liable for extra costs over and above the original fine.

## 2. Drink and Drugs including Medicine

2.1 The Company operates a zero-tolerance drink and drug driving policy.

2.2 All drivers must report any pending prosecutions and/or cautions immediately, regardless of whose vehicle they were driving at the time. Failure to do so will result in disciplinary action.

2.3 Any driver prosecuted for such offences will be subject to the disciplinary procedure which may result in dismissal. 

2.4 All employees are encouraged to report concerns about colleagues with regards to drink or drugs as soon as possible. This can be done anonymously if necessary. 

2.5 Any driver who believes that they may be over the drink drive limit must inform their line manager. They must not drive. They may be given alternative duties if available or be required to take annual leave. Should this become a regular occurrence, disciplinary action may take place.

If you are involved in an accident and there is a possibility that you were not concentrating due to phone use, for example, you may also be charged with ‘driving without due care and attention’, or worse.
