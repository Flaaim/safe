1.	It is the policy of the [Company] to ensure that each homeworker has a safe environment from which to work and that <Company> provided equipment should not cause health and safety concerns for the member of staff. 


2.	All staff who work from home should use this Checklist. You should complete the checklist and flag up in the ‘employee comments’ section any areas where there may be potential problems and what you intend to do about them. Your line manager will need to be happy that your home environment is suitable, and therefore it is likely that a visit to your home will be necessary to verify this.

### 1. Temperature 

The minimum temperature in a workplace should be at least 16C but a temperature of around 21-24C is normally considered comfortable for sedentary work. Are you able to provide and maintain this level of heating when required? 

In hot weather a fan plus increased ventilation may be necessary to achieve a comfortable working temperature. Are you able to achieve a comfortable working temperature during periods of hot weather?

### 3. Ventilation 

Is there adequate ventilation – for example if you have converted an area of your home into a study / office is there a means of providing ventilation? 

### 4. Fire 

The equipment you use for work and the configuration of your working area should not obstruct your means of escape or the means of escape for others. It is a general recommendation that smoke detectors are installed and maintained in your home.

### 8. Work equipment not provided by <Company> 

It is advisable that the employee ensures any equipment used, which is not supplied by the company, is safe and fit for purpose. This requires it to be used and maintained in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
