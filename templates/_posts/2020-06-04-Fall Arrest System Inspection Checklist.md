### Anchorage Points
1. Do workers know appropriate anchorage points for each task that requires a fall-arrest or restraint system?
2. Are all anchorage points capable of supporting at least 2000 kilograms per person attached and supervised by a qualified person?
3. Are all anchorage points for body harnesses located at shoulder height and are anchorage points for self retracting lifeline systems located overhead?
4. Are anchorage points independent of the working surface?
5. Can a worker move from one station to another or climb up and down without exposure to a fall?
6. If the lifeline, lanyard, or self-retracting lifeline is not permanently attached to an anchorage point at the elevated work area, is the first worker up or the last worker down protected while climbing and traversing?
### Vertical Lifelines
7. Does the lifeline have a minimum breaking strength of 2000 kilograms)?
8. Is the lifeline protected from abrasive or cutting edges?
9. Does the system provide fall protection as the worker connects to and releases from the lifeline?
10. Is the lifeline arranged so workers never have to hold it for balance? (A lifeline should never be used for balance.)
11. Is the vertical segment integrated with the horizontal segment to provide continuous fall protection?
### Horizontal Lifelines
12. Has the entire horizontal lifeline system been designed and approved by a qualified person?
13. Have the anchorages to which the lifeline is attached been designed and evaluated specifically for a horizontal lifeline?
14. Has the designer of the system approved the number of workers who will be using it?
15. Is the rope or cable free from signs of wear or abrasion?
16. Does the rope or cable have the required initial sag?
17. Have the workers been warned about potential falls?
18. Have the clearances been checked?
19. Is the hardware riding on the horizontal lifeline made of steel? (Aluminum is not permitted because it wears excessively.)
### Fall Arresters (Rope Grabs)
20. Is the fall arrester compatible with the lifeline on which it is to be installed or operated?
21. Is the fall arrester in operational condition?
22. Is the fall arrester equipped with a changeover lever that allows it to become a stationary anchor on the lifeline?
23. Is the fall arrester equipped with a locking mechanism that prevents unintentional opening of the device and subsequent disengagement from the lifeline?
24. Is the fall arrester’s “up” direction marked properly so the equipment can be attached to the line correctly?
25. Is the fall arrester included in a regular maintenance program?
### Lanyards
26. Is the lanyard length as short as necessary and in no cases greater than 6 feet (1.8 meters)?
27. Are manually adjustable lanyards used when it is desirable to be able to take slack out of the lanyard?
28. Have you prohibited tying of knots from the lanyard to the lifeline? (Mechanical rope grabs or fall arresters must be used.)
29. Are double lanyards provided?
### Retractable Lifeline (RL)
30. Are workers properly trained to use an RL?
31. Is the RL under a regular maintenance and inspection program?
32. Is the end of the cable properly spliced? (thimble eye, Flemish eye-spliced, and swaged fitting/ferrule?)
### Body Harnesses
33. Are full-body harnesses selected for a particular job equipped with all necessary attachment points (for fall arresting, work positioning, descent control, rescue, or ladder fall-protection systems)?
34. Are body harnesses inspected regularly for wear, abrasion, broken stitching, and missing hardware?
35. Have workers been instructed in the use and care of body harnesses/body belts?
### Other Considerations
36. Has the free-fall distance been considered so that a worker will not strike a lower surface or object before the fall is arrested?
37. Have pendulum-swing fall hazards been eliminated?
38. Have safe methods to retrieve fallen workers been planned?
39. Is all of the fall-arrest equipment free of potential damage from welding, chemical corrosion, or sandblasts?
40. Are all components of the system compatible according to the manufacturer’s instructions?
41. Have employees been properly trained in the following issues?
– Manufacturer’s recommendations, restrictions, instructions, and warnings
– Location of appropriate anchorage points and attachment techniques
– Problems associated with elongation, method of use, inspection, and storage

42. Are all regular inspections performed by trained inspectors?
43. Are written reports maintained?
