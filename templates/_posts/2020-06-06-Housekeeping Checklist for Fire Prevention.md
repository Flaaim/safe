Good housekeeping is an important part of reducing the fire risk of a property. Accumulations of combustible scrap materials and trash can provide a fuel source and contribute to fire development. Additionally, accumulations of dust and small fibrous materials will increase the likelihood of a flash fire or dust explosion. The following basic housekeeping procedures should be established. 

## General 

1. Are aisles free of equipment, raw material, and scrap? 
2. Is equipment and machinery designed to allow for easy cleaning and organized to allow for removal of waste?
3. Are floors cleaned daily to prevent the buildup of dust, waste paper, and scrap?
4. If smoking is permitted, are designated smoking areas established and “No Smoking” signs posted in all other areas of the facility?
5. Are non-combustible receptacles for smoking materials provided and routinely emptied by the staff? 

## Trash

1. Are trash containers emptied daily? 
2. Are trash containers, with a capacity greater than 40 gal (0.15 m3 ), made from noncombustible materials?
3. Are trash dumpsters and trash containers, with a capacity greater than 40.5 ft3 (1.15 m3 ), stored outside buildings, and not within 10 ft (3m) of combustible walls, openings, or combustible roof eaves lines?
4. Are trash separated by type (i.e., wood, paper, oily rags) and placed in noncombustible containers? 
5. Is waste from packaging, such as shredded paper and plastic, removed form the work area daily? 

## Cooking 

1. Are cooking appliances equipped with easily accessible and removable noncombustible grease filters?
2. Are grease containers emptied at least daily? 
3. Are raw materials storage areas routinely monitored and cleaned to prevent the buildup of combustible dusts, such as from sugar and starches? 
4. Are hoods and ducts vented to the exterior of the building and provided with an accessible opening for inspection and cleaning? 



## Dust Control 
1. Are good housekeeping practices followed, including routine cleaning of dusts over 1/8 in (3.18 mm) in depth from all surfaces?
2. Is the access to dust collection areas restricted? 
3. Is electrical equipment that is installed in dust collection areas, listed/approved for Class II Division 1 use?
## Flammable and Combustible Liquids
1. Are drip pans under equipment cleaned daily to prevent the accumulations of flammable liquids?
2. Are liquid-soaked rags and paper from cleaning operations placed in covered metal containers and disposed of on a daily basis? 
## Laundry 
1. Are dryer exhaust systems routed away from combustible materials and access provided for routine cleaning?
2. Is the lint from clothes dryers removed on a regular basis? 
## Spray Finishing
1. Are spray areas kept free of the accumulation of deposits of combustible residues? 
2. Are filters for ventilating and exhaust systems replaced on a regular basis?
## Refrigeration 
1. Are compressors, fans, and circulation equipment used in freezers, coolers, and cold storage rooms included in a regular cleaning and maintenance program?
