1. Weil's disease — a serious and potentially fatal infection that is transmitted to humans by contact with urine from infected rats
2. Hardjo form of leptospirosis — Transmitted from cattle to humans.

The symptoms for both diseases start with an Influenza-like illness with a persistent and severe headache and possibly chills. Later symptoms are can lead too vomiting, muscle pains and ultimately to jaundice, meningitis and kidney failure. In rare cases the disease can be fatal.
