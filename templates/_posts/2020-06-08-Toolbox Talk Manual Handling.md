## We should consider the following:

1. Always use mechanical handling methods instead of manual handling if possible e.g. forklifts and levers.
2. Know your capabilities; only tackle lifts you can handle.
3. Can you handle the load yourself, do you need assistance?
4. Is there a clear walkway with good lighting to the work area?

Checks that should be carried out before lifting:
1. Always check you know the weight of the load before lifting
2. Wear gloves to protect against cuts and punctures
3. Wear safety boots or shoes to protect from falling loads
4. Carry out a trial lift by rocking the load from side to side, then
5. Try lifting it a small amount to get a ‘feel’ for it.

By doing so we hope to be able to: -

Reduce the Number of accidents and incidents on site

- Do stand reasonably close to the load, feet hip-width apart, one foot slightly forward pointing in the direction you’re going
- Bend your knees and keep your back straight
- Get a secure grip on the load
- Breathe in before lifting as this helps support the spine
- Use a good lifting technique, keep your back straight and lifting using your legs
- Keep the load close to your body
- Lift slowly and smoothly
- When to or more people are lifting a load, one person must take control and co-ordinate the lift


- DON’T carry a load too close to your body
- DON’T carry a load that obscures your vision
- AVOID jerky and sharp movement
- AVOID twisting your body when lifting or carrying a load
- DON’T lift to a height from the floor, do the lift in stages

## BAD MANUAL HANDLING TECHNIQUES WILL ONLY CAUSEINJURIES
