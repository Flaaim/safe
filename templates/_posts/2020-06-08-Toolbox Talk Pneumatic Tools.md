## What are pneumatic tools?

Pneumatic tools are powered by compressed air. Common types of these air-powered hand tools are road and concrete breakers, vibrating pokers and cleaning lances, most likely supplied by a tow able compressor.

As with all tools and equipment you must ensure that you wear all the appropriate PPE and RPE that has been Image: Correct Use of identified as required and you are provided such as goggles, gloves and dust masks.

1. Ensure that the compressed air supplied to the tool is clean and dry. Dust, moisture, and corrosive fumes can damage a tool.
2. Keep tools clean and lubricated.
3. Use only the attachments that the manufacturer recommends for the tools you are using, inspect the points of breakers for signs of wear and replace as required.
4. Be careful to prevent hands, feet, or body from injury in case the machine slips or the tool breaks.
