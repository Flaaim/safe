You must wear eye protection where there is a risk of injury to the eyes.

Examples of work activities requiring eye protection are as follows: -

1. Cutting bricks or block with anything i.e. when using bolster hammer and cold chisel or cutting- off wheel.
2. The use of a cartridge-fixing tool.
3. The use of an abrasive wheel (Cut-off saw, ‘Whizzer’).
4. Striking of masonry nails. (Even the site Engineer)
5. The use of compressed air to blow swarf, dust or dirt from an area (Cleaning formwork or preparing a pour would come into this category).
5. Drilling, cutting or breaking metal or concrete. 
6. Welding or cutting steelwork.
7. Handling, spraying or brushing any substance that, if splashed into the eyes, will cause injuries.
8. Pouring concrete by skip, pump or even machine bucket

In your own interest, make sure you wear protective goggles or glasses when instructed to do so.

The eye protection that is provided must be suitable for you and must be replaced immediately if lost or damaged. You must take care of the eye protection you are provided with.
