Almost every person who regularly pulls a trailer has some type of experience where they’ve lost their trailer or almost lost their trailer. Some of these stories may have had uneventful endings; however, trailers have the potential of becoming unguided missiles if they are not properly hooked up or cared for.

## TRAILER HOOK-UP PROCEDURE

1. Prior to hook-up, check the hitch on the tow vehicle for loose bolts and attaching pins. Also, check the ball on the tow vehicle to make sure that it matches the tongue size on the trailer.
2. Check electrical connector plug on vehicle for loose or frayed wires.
3. Hook trailer to tow vehicle: Check for proper ball size and check to ensure that the hitch is securely attached.
4. Attach safety chains to tow vehicle.
5. Connect the electrical plug.
6. Check to ensure that the hazard, brake and signal lights are operating satisfactory. Check electric brake control (if applicable) to ensure trailer is braking properly. If not, complete an equipment repair form.
7. Test the emergency breakaway system (if applicable).
8. Check tires for proper inflation.
9. Check all gates and latches.
10. Ensure that any loose materials have been tarped or secured tied down

## TRAILER SAFE WORK PRACTICES

- Load your trailer with more weight in front of the trailer axle than behind it. This gives the trailer tongue weight and can also add more stability to the tow vehicle and trailer.
- Ensure that the trailer ball matches the trailer tongue. Never try to make due with two dissimilar hitches.
- TEST THE TRAILER EACH TIME YOU HOOK IT UP TO ENSURE THAT IT IS SECURELY ATTACHED.
- Tarp down all loose material such as asphalt or concrete, and secure all tools and equipment.
- Tag out any trailer that requires repair, notify your supervisor and complete an equipment repair form.
- When unhooking the trailer, ensure it is on level ground, or block the wheels, to prevent the trailer from rolling forward into the truck, or rolling backwards, possibly down a hill.
