## CUT-OFF SAW SAFE WORK PRACTICES

Only qualified personnel are allowed to operate a cut-off saw.  When using this piece of equipment, it is important to remember the following dos and don’ts.

### DOS

1. Use safety footwear, snug fitting clothing, safety glasses, hearing protection and a hardhat while operating the cut-off saw.  A respirator with HEPA filters must be worn while cutting concrete or asphalt.
2.	Dust concentrations must be maintained below the established exposure limits.  Keep water continuously running on the cutting wheel while cutting concrete or asphalt.
3.	Only use wet/dry cut-off saw blades while cutting concrete or asphalt.
4.	Operate the cut-off saw in well-ventilated areas.
5.	Inspect the cut-off saw before start-up, CLEAN THE AIR FILTER.
6.	Inspect the cutting wheel for warping and damage before using the cut-off saw.
7.	Run the saw at full throttle while cutting.
8.	Use the bottom of the wheel for cutting.
9.	Test newly mounted wheels to run at normal operating speed for approx. 30 seconds with guard in place before beginning to use.
10.	Hold the cut-off saw with 2 hands while it is running
11.	Use caution when handling fuel.  Do not fuel cut-off saw while it is running and do not fuel up saw near an ignition source.
12.	Keep all parts of your body away from the cutting wheel while it is running.
13.	Run the cut-off saw for 30 seconds at normal operating speeds after the cut is finished to allow all of the water to be thrown off the cutting wheel. 
14.	Keep good balance and footing; use both hands and keep a firm grip on the handles.
15.	Keep work piece at a comfortable distance.
16.	Run saw at full throttle.
17.	Be careful when re-entering a cut.
18.	Be alert to ensure that the cut-off saw blade does not become pinched in the cut.


### DON’TS

1.	Don’t allow bystanders to stand in the work area while using a cut-off saw.
2.	Don’t cut in the vicinity of anything that is flammable.  Most cutting produces sparks.
3.	Don’t operate the cut-off saw without the wheel guard in place.
4.	Don’t exceed the maximum operating speed marked on the wheel.
5.	Don’t cock, jam or wedge the wheel into a cut.

7.	Don’t operate a cut-off saw that is damaged, improperly adjusted or improperly assembled.
8.	Don’t use water on a dry cutting wheel, or sprinkle the blade periodically with water.  (Sudden temperature changes will weaken the wheel)
9.	Never cut with the top or front of the blade
10.	Never cut above shoulder height.
11.	Make sure you can contact people in the event of an incident.
