## JOB-SITE CELLULAR PHONE USAGE

Although cellular phones have proven themselves to be a valuable asset to the road construction industry, they have also proven themselves to be a danger as well.  On several occasions it has been noted that employees have been speaking on their cell phones while operating machinery and working in close proximity to equipment.  This can be particularly dangerous since one simple breakdown in communication could lead to a serious injury or even a fatality.

To ensure the safety of our crews, provide a safe work environment, and to minimize the risk of injury,

The use of PERSONAL CELL PHONES is not permissible while on the job site.  

These devices must be left in the employeeâ€™s vehicle for use prior to start of shift, at a scheduled lunch break, after shift or as deemed permissible by the direct supervisor.

Supervisors who have been issued COMPANY CELL PHONES may use them on the job-site; however, they are reminded to use caution when doing so.  Before, answering or using a cell phone on site, ensure you are in a safe area (Out of the line of fire of equipment and vehicular traffic).

## REMINDER

All signs and stands are to be picked up at the end of the day unless they must remain in place to warn people of any hazards. Ie: bumps, low shoulders, grooved pavement, etc.
