The sun and warm weather of summer can also bring special hazards for those working outdoors. The combination of heat, humidity and physical labor can lead to illness. The two most serious forms of heat-related illnesses are heat exhaustion (primarily from dehydration) and heat stroke. Signs of heat exhaustion or heat stroke need immediate attention. Recognizing those warning signs and taking quick action can make a difference in preventing heat illnesses.

The following are guidelines all employees should follow during the warm weather months:

Understand what heat stress is and be able to recognize the symptoms. It is a    signal that says the body is having difficulty maintaining its narrow  temperature range. The heart pumps faster, blood is diverted from internal    organs to the skin, breathing rate increases, sweating increases, all in    an attempt to transfer more heat to the outside air and cool the skin by    evaporation of sweat. If the body can't keep up then the person suffers    effects ranging from heat cramps to heat exhaustion, and finally to heat stroke.

Symptoms of Heat Exhaustion include headaches, dizziness, lightheadness or fainting;    weakness and moist skin; mood changes such as irritability or confusion;    upset stomach or vomiting.

Symptoms of Heat Stroke include dry, hot skin with no sweating; mental confusion or    loss of consciousness; seizures or convulsions. Seek professional    assistance immediately.

Dry clothes and skin do not mean that    you are not sweating. In dry climates, you might not feel wet or    sticky, but you are still sweating. On a very warm day, you can lose as    much as two liters of fluid.

Beat the    Heat. Help Prevent the ill effects of heat stress by:

1. Drinking water or Gatorade frequently and moderately (about eight ounces every 15 minutes.)
2. If possible, avoid direct sunlight or other heat sources.
3. Try to plan your day to tackle more strenuous jobs during the cooler morning hours.
4. Utilizing the ventilation or fans in enclosed areas.
5. Rest frequently in cool, shaded areas.
6. Avoid alcoholic or caffeinated beverages and eat lightly.
7. Remembering that it takes about one to two weeks for the body to adjust to the heat; this adaptation to heat is quickly lost â€” so your body will need time to adjust after a vacation or extended absence.
8. Wearing lightweight, light-colored and loose fitting clothes.
9. Wear wide brimmed hard hats, neck protectors (Chill-Its) and sunscreen

Be prepared    to act. In the event you recognize these symptoms in    yourself or a co-worker, immediately notify your supervisor and contact    emergency professionals. While waiting for First Aid or Medical Aid, you    should:
1. Move the worker to a cool shaded area
2. Loosen or remove heavy clothing
3. Provide small sips of cool drinking water
4. Fan and mist the person with water
