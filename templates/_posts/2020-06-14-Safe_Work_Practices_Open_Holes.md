## 1.    Purpose
Open holes are dangerous and  could cause injury to a worker.
## 2.    Definitions
Examples  of open holes would include: hydro-vacuumed holes, rat or mouse holes  (drilling operations), scaffold decking missing, portions of floor  temporarily removed from walkways, stairs, and/or buildings, roof holes, bell  holes, etc.
## 3.    Hazards
1. Falling into or  through
2. Tripping at  level or into
3. Inadequate  lighting
4. Congested work  area
5. Driving or  backing into
6. Public or  visitors to site

## 4.    Prerequisites

None

## 5.    Precautions
1. Determine  whether or not the hole is considered a risk based on this list or other  risks not identified above.
2. Open  holes shall require a guardrail and toe boards if there is potential of work  being completed below the level of the opening.
3. If  the decision is to use a cover, it must be a securely installed temporary  covering that will withstand the loading effect from the combined maximum weight  of the most probable assemblage of workers, equipment and materials. All  whole covers must be secured and marked “OPEN HOLE.”
4. Erect  appropriate caution/danger signs and/or snow fence.
5. Flashing  lights or traffic signage, as required.
6. If  a person removes a cover, guardrail or toe board, or part of them, protecting  an opening or hole for any reason, you must ensure a temporary cover or other  means of protection replaces it immediately.
7. If  a temporary cover is used to protect an opening or hole, you must ensure a  warning sign or marking, clearly indicating the nature of the hazard:
- Is  posted near or fixed on the cover, and
- Is  not removed unless another effective means of protection is immediately  provided.
8. Open  holes should be identified in any permits.
