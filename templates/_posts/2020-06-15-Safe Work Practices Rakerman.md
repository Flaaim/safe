1. Inspect tools prior to use each shift. Ensure the ends are protected and handles are not bent or broken. If defects are found, report to the Supervisor and remove from service.
2. The minimum personal protective equipment is a hardhat, steel toed boots and high visibility vest. Hearing protection as required. 
3. Always watch the rake handles around moving traffic and other workers.
4. Pull or push a suitable amount to your ability. Do not try to push or pull too much.
5. Switch hands when raking for extended periods of time. Alternate tasks if the body becomes sore or weak. 
6. Workers must know the signs and symptoms of heat stress and respond accordingly. Drink plenty of water during each shift and rest in shaded areas when needed.
7. Avoid standing on the asphalt mix for long periods of time, as most footwear does not prevent the heat from affecting the feet. Stand on the perimeter of the asphalt.
8. When working near the roller or dump trucks, always maintain eye contact with the operator. Make sure the operator is stopped and aware if you must move out of view.
9. Always watch the equipment in the work zone and obey the direction given by the Traffic Control Person. 
10. Stay inside the lane closure. 
11. Provide clear direction to dump truck operators. Stop the operation and discuss signaling if this is not clearly understood. 
12. Equipment backing up must have a back-up alarm. Inform the Supervisor if any equipment is not equipped with a back-up alarm.
13. Help the dump truck operators when in proximity to overhead wires or other obstructions. 
14. Do not walk backwards without checking first. Be aware of uneven terrain, especially when raking around curbs
