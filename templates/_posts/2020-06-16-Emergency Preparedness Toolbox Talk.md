Emergencies can occur any time without warning. The more you are prepared for them, the better you will be able to act, minimizing panic and confusion when an emergency occurs.

If an emergency occurs, there will be a need to make quick emergency call(s) that will minimize injuries and damage. Such phone calls are easier if an emergency contact is made readily available.

The  following necessary measures are required to deal with emergency situations  associated with injuries, equipment damage, fire or facility damage.
1. All employees know  where the first aid kit, spill kit, fire extinguisher and nearest hospital  location are for the work-site they are working.
2. On-site resources  such as fire extinguishers, spills kit and first aid kits must be maintained  and clearly identified.
3. Emergency equipment  is stored where it will be accessible in the event of an emergency.
4. All employees are  trained in emergency procedures and shown where equipment is stored.

## FIRST AID KITS, FIRE EXTINGUISHERS, SPILL KIT, HOSPITAL LOCATIONS
At  the start of each job, site supervisors (Foremen) should ensure that all  employees under their command know where each of the above mentioned items  are for use in an emergency situation.
1. They also need  to cover where the muster point  is, in case of an emergency.
2. On large jobs,  the muster point is covered in the orientation.
3. On smaller jobs,  a muster point should be chosen that is in a safe area.  There should be no overhead hazards that  could fall and injure a worker.
4. If a foreman is  unaware of the location of these items, they should contact their  superintendent and request the information prior to reaching the job-site
## FIRST AID
1. After an emergency situation, emergency services (fire, police and medical) may be unavailable for some time. It may be necessary to provide immediate care for an injured person if medical professionals cannot be reached. It is important to have a complete first aid kit and first aid training.
2. Workers must have immediate access to an appropriate first aid kit at each site location. First aid kits may be permanent on-site kits or may be transported to the site by the worker for each site visit.
3. In some instances, the first aid kit may need to be located in the workerâ€™s vehicle and carried by the worker to the site location.
