Company  name (the  “Company”)  accepts  that  its  activities  generate  waste  material. Therefore, the  Environmental  Policy  of  the  Company  is  to  ensure  so  far  as  it  is  reasonably practicable  that  all  its  operations  will  be  carried  out  with  a  commitment  to  reducing  waste, thereby protecting and enhancing the environment.  The same commitment will be expected to be shown by contractors working for the Company. 

Concern  and  awareness for  the  environment  is  a  fundamental  principle  of  the  Company’s business. 

The  Company  therefore  seeks  to  comply  with  all  relevant  environmental  legislation  and regulation.  It also aims to establish higher standards of environmental performance including waste management where these are practicable and appropriate.
 
The  Company  employees  are  required  to carry  out  their  duties  with  concern  for  the environment.   It  is  a  condition  of  employment  that  all  staff  comply  with  this Environmental Policy Statement


In the  event  of  an  environmental  accident  or  incident  at  work,  it  is  a  Company  requirement that  the  details  are  promptly  and  properly  reported  to  the  Directors/Owners who  will investigate and take prompt action to make good any damage and avoid recurrence. 

All  contractors  working  on  behalf  of  the  Company  are  required  to  adopt  environmental standards  fully  consistent  with  those  of  the  Company  and  they  are  expected  to  achieve comparable levels of performance as a condition of their contract.
