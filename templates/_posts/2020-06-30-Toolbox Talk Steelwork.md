## Introduction:    
1. Steelwork carries with it significant inherent risk, both to those erecting steelwork, and to those in the vicinity. Only safe systems of work can control these risks and reduce them to an acceptable level. 

## Main Points:

1. Only suitably trained personnel should undertake steelwork, or trainees under suitable supervision. 
2. A risk assessment must be carried out and a method statement produced for any steelwork.
3. Suitable PPE should always be worn, both by steelworkers and by other employees in the vicinity. 

## Points to remember 
1. Plan steelwork according to the method statement, remembering to take into account the use of cranes or other lifting equipment and accessories and co-ordinate with other site activities.
2. If cranes are to be used consider the ground conditions, potential danger to other employees and the public as a result of crane arcs and the need to ensure continued serviceability of lifting equipment.
3. Utilise slingers and banksmen where appropriate. 
4. Beware of any overhead services.
5. As an absolute minimum head and foot protection should be worn. Ensure there is safe access/egress to/from places of work.
6. Ensure there is safe access/egress to/from places of work. 
7. Where possible work from a stable working platform.
8. Where no working platform is available, utilise a safety harness and fall arrest device — ensure it is clipped on at all times.
9. Beware of dangers to those below — consider exclusion zones, nets etc as appropriate.  Do not leave tools/equipment on steelwork. 
10. Never move along beams by straddling unless absolutely necessary — clip on as soon as is practicable.
