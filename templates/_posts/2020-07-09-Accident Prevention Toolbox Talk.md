Whilst overall accident statistics indicate a general reduction, the construction industry remains the exception by showing an increase. It is essential that all personnel contribute in every way possible to reduce accident rates in construction.
## Main Points
-	Equipment does not cause accidents — people do!
-	Every accident is owned by someone somewhere!
-	It’s too late to plan for safety after an accident has happened!

-	Use of faulty equipment and “homemade’ repairs.
-	Illegal adaptations and illegal removal of guards/barriers.
