Flammable Liquids including petroleum based adhesives and paint products are used extensively throughout the construction industry and carry with them the risk of fire, serious accidents and injury
## Main Points
- Always look for the hazard symbol and wording on containers.  
- Only ever have the minimum quantities at the place of work. Keep the remainder in suitable stores. 
- Always keep the lid on containers when not in immediate use and store correctly
## Points to remember
1. Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions.  
2. Keep away from open flames and sources of heat.  They can ignite at relatively low temperatures. 
3. Do not smoke in areas where FL’s are used or stored and do not use equipment which generates heat and/or sparks (including electrical sparks).  
4. FL vapours are generally heavier than air and will accumulate at ground level if they cannot disperse. Beware of drains, excavations, pits etc both when using and storing FL’s.  
5. FL vapours can also be toxic, making you drowsy etc. Only use in well ventilated areas, or, if this is not possible, respiratory protective equipment may have to be worn.  
6. FL storage should comprise containers made of non-flammable material.  (Don’t forget the vapour hazards — ensure there is ventilation.)  
7. Clear up any spillage immediately and safely dispose of contaminated cleaning materials. If inside a building, consider assisting vapour dispersal by opening windows, doors etc.  
8. Consider covering drains to protect against entry by substance or its vapour where necessary and practicable.
