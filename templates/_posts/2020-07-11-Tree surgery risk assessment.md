### Hz No.

3.
4.
5. 
6. 
### Hazard description
Cuts and abrasions
Fall from heights
Manual handling
Using power tools – chain saws
Flying debris – eye damage
Falling objects
### How are persons affected?

e.g. Operatives can suffer cuts to their fingers or hands from plant thorns, or from using cutting or trimming tools

e.g. Operatives can suffer serious injuries if they fall while accessing high areas

e.g. Pulling branches while clambering about in trees may result in muscle strain

e.g. Operatives may suffer serious cuts or burns from contact with chainsaw blades

E.g. Operatives will be injured if they are struck by flying debris or dust etc

E.g. Passers by can be injured if they area struck by branches dropped or falling

### Level of Risk

P - <<e.g.4>> - <<e.g.4>> - <<e.g.4>> - <<e.g.4>> - <<e.g.4>> - <<e.g.4>>

S - <<e.g.3>> - <<e.g.5>> - <<e.g.3>> - <<e.g.4>> - <<e.g.4>> - <<e.g.4>>

R - <<e.g.12>> - <<e.g.20>> - <<e.g.12>> - <<e.g.16>> - <<e.g.4>> - <<e.g.4>>

### Existing controls

<<e.g. All operatives to wear gloves if practicable>>

<<e.g. Site supervisor to ensure that only qualified personnel carry out work at heights. All works to be carried out using appropriate harnesses. Operatives to be harness trained>>

<<e.g. Operatives to cut and remove branches as per their training>>

<<e.g. Site supervisor to ensure that only qualified personnel use chainsaws>>

<<Operatives to wear suitable eye protection at all times >>

<<Operatives to take care where cut branches are dropped >>

### Further controls / action

<<e.g. All operatives to be given Toolbox Talks on general safety>>

<<e.g. Site supervisor to ensure that suitable access /working platforms are available if appropriate>>

<<e.g. Operatives to attend Manual Handling course>>

<<e.g. Operatives to ensure that they are competent to use the equipment>>

<< Site supervisor to ensure that all protocols are followed>>

<< Site supervisor to ensure that working area is kept clear of non essential personnel>>

### Probability (P) 5=very likely, 4=likely, 3=quite possible, 2=possible, 1=unlikely
### Severity (S) 5=fatal, 4=severe, 3=moderate, 2=slight, 1=negligible
### Risk (R) 0-8=low risk, no action required. 9-15=medium risk, ensure adequate controls are in use. 16-25=high risk, stop operation & implement control measures
