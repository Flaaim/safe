Inspection and maintenance is a requirement for all RPE except for disposable types and should be carried out by properly trained personnel. Thorough maintenance, examination and tests should be carried out at least once a month. However, if the RPE is used only occasionally, an examination and test should be carried out before use and, in any event, the interval should not exceed three months.

To use this form it is advised that the inspector addresses each question relevant to the RPE type and provides descriptive comments and details any remedial actions that need to take place.  This form should  then  be  handed  to  the  Health  &  Safety  Representative  for  the  record  keeping  and  action planning
