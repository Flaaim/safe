### 1.0      Telephone Threats

1.1.      Obtain as much detailed information as possible from the source, using the ‘Threatening Telephone Call Information’ form.

1.2.      Notify the supervisor or another employee by a pre-arranged signal system to alert management.

1.3.      Attempt to keep the caller talking as long as possible to enable the origin of the call to be traced.

1.4.      Immediately following the telephone call, repeat all information received, so that the appropriate action can be taken, i.e. to evacuate or search.

Note: - The decision to evacuate or search must be made by the Site General Manager, based on the type of call and the information given by the caller. The call may come through a second party, e.g. the police or press and, if a specific time is stated for a bomb to detonate, the obvious decision would be to evacuate.

### 2.0	Letter Bombs

2.1.	Experience in dealing with letter bombs indicates that in many cases they are: -
2.1.1.	Placed in substantial envelopes or parcels containing paperback books
2.1.2.	In the form of flat letters weighing up to 102g
2.1.3.	In packages the size of a conventional book
2.1.4.	Delivered through normal postal services

2.2.	The degree of caution to be observed in handling such items can be determined by the cumulative effect of the points giving rise to suspicion which including the following: -

2.3.	The postmark, if foreign and not familiar

2.3.1.	The writing, which may have an unusual appearance, lack literacy, or is crudely printed.
2.3.2.	The name and address of the sender, if the geographical area differs from the area of the postmark
2.3.3.	‘Personal’ or ‘private’ letters addressed to senior management under the job title rather than by name.
2.3.4.	Weight, if excessive for the size and apparent contents
2.3.5.	Weight distribution, if uneven, this may indicate the presence of batteries
2.3.6.	Grease marks on the exterior of the wrapping (i.e. showing through from the inside), may indicate ‘sweaty’ explosive
2.3.7.	Smell, some explosives have a smell of marzipan or almonds
2.3.8.	Abnormal fastening, if the sealing is excessive for the type of package, this may be a form of booby trap 

2.4.	Damaged enveloped or packaging that exposes wires, batteries or fluid-filled plastic sachets should not be handled further.
 
2.5.	Packages that rattle, feel springy or emit a ticking noise should be treated with extreme caution.

2.6.	If suspicions cannot be alleviated: -

2.6.1.	Do not attempt to open the letter/package or tamper with it. It will probably have been designed to withstand postal handling and to detonate during a normal sequence of opening
2.6.2.	With minimum further handling, isolate it to reduce possible blast damage, place on table, clear all items from around it
2.6.3.	Seal off the area to keep people away


### 3.0	Evacuate or Search

3.1.	This decision must be made by the Site General Manager or Deputy Manager, based on the type of call and information given by the caller. The call may come via a second party, e.g. the police or the press and if a specific time is stated for a bomb to detonate, the obvious decision would be to evacuate.

### 4.0	Bomb Search

4.1.	If the decision is taken to search the premises as opposed to either a full or partial evacuation, the services of the local Police or Bomb Disposal Authorities should be sought.

4.2.	The following points must be considered when undertaking the search: -

4.2.1.	Do not use portable radio transmitters as they can detonate explosive devices within a radius of 30 metres
4.2.2.	Divide the hub site into pre-determined sections with a thorough search plan for each section.
4.2.3.	If possible, utilise staff members familiar with the area to be searched, as they are more likely to identify packages that should not be there
4.2.4.	As a bomb would most likely be concealed in a compartment, suitcase, briefcase, box or packaging, be suspicious of any items that are unattended or out of place.
4.2.5.	Seal off all areas that have been searched to avoid repetition of the search

4.3.	If there is any reason to believe that a bomb or incendiary device has been found, the following precautionary measures should be carefully observed: -

### 5.0	DO NOT: -

5.1.	Attempt to open a suspected package, leave it in its original position
5.2.	Place a package believed to contain a bomb or incendiary device in water, water is a conductor of electricity and may cause detonation
5.3.	Cut, remove or undo string or wire on a suspected package as this may release the trigger mechanism and cause the detonation.
5.4.	Lift the cover of a box believed to contain a bomb or incendiary device

### 5.5.	DO:
5.6.	Cordon off the area, to prevent entry by unauthorised persons whilst awaiting expert assistance
5.7.	Remain calm; keep voices as low as possible. Move in a positive style but do not run.
5.8.	Do not openly speculate within hearing distance of any employee or visitor. All actions should reflect a ‘business as usual’ attitude

### 6.0	Bomb Evacuation
6.1.	When the decision to evacuate the premises has been taken, the object is to get people out quickly without panic or disorder.

6.2.	The fire alarm system is the most efficient method of initiating an evacuation, but the following procedures should also be observed: -

6.2.1.	All lifts should be called to one floor above the ground floor, switched to manual operation and held there
6.2.2.	All personnel to assemble at the designated muster point and await instructions
6.2.3.	Do not allow entry or re-entry into the building until given approval by the Police or Bomb Disposal Officers
